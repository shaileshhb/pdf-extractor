<ol>
  <li>
    <b>(A) General information</b>
    <p>
      Balkrishna Industries Limited (‘the Company’) is engaged mainly in the business of manufacturing and selling of
      “Off-Highway Tires” (OHT) in the specialist segments such as Agricultural, Industrial & Construction, Earthmovers
      & Port, Mining, Forestry, Lawn & Garden and All Terrain Vehicles (ATV).
    </p>
    <p>
      The company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in India and has its registered office at Waluj
      MIDC, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Maharashtra, India.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>(B) Material Accounting policies</b>
    <ol type='a'>
      <li>
        <b>Basis of preparation</b><br />
        (i) The financial statements have been prepared in compliance with Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) notified
        under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act) [Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015] and
        other relevant provisions of the Act.<br />
        (ii) The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for the following assets
        and liabilities which have been measured at fair value:<br />
        1. Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss<br />
        2. Financial instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income<br />
        3. Defined benefit plans – plan assets measured at fair value
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Presentation of financial statements</b><br />
        The Balance Sheet, the Statement of Profit and Loss and the Statement of Changes in Equity are prepared and
        presented in the format prescribed in the Schedule III to the Companies Act, 2013 (the Act). The Statement of
        Cash Flows has been prepared and presented in accordance with Ind AS 7 “Statement of Cash Flows”. The
        disclosures with respect to items in the Balance Sheet and Statement of Profit and Loss, as prescribed in the
        Schedule III to the Act, are presented by way of notes forming part of the financial statements along with the
        other notes required to be disclosed under Ind AS and the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements)
        Regulations, 2015 as amended.<br />
        All amounts disclosed in the financial statements and notes have been presented in crore rounded off to two
        decimal places as per the requirement of Schedule III, unless otherwise stated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Foreign currency translation</b><br />
        (i) <b>Functional and presentation currency</b><br />
        Items included in the financial statements of the Company are measured using the currency of the primary
        economic environment in which the entity operates (‘the functional currency’). The standalone financial
        statements are presented in Indian rupee (₹), which is the company’s functional and presentation currency.<br /><br />
        (ii) <b>Transactions and balances</b><br />
        Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at
        the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such
        transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at
        year end exchange rates are generally recognised in profit and loss.<br /><br />
        Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates
        at the date when the fair value was determined. Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at
        fair value are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. The gain or loss arising on translation of
        non-monetary items measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the
        change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or loss is
        recognised in OCI or profit and loss are also recognised in OCI or profit and loss, respectively).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Revenue recognition</b><br />
        The Company has adopted Ind AS 115, Revenue from Contract with Customers.<br /><br />
        Revenue is measured at the transaction price of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue from sale of
        goods is recognised; when the significant risks and rewards in respect of ownership of products are transferred
        by the Company, the entity retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated
        with

<p>
  ownership nor effective control over the goods sold and no significant uncertainty exist regarding the amount of
  consideration that will be derived from the sale of goods as well as regarding its ultimate collection. Amounts
  disclosed as revenue are net of variable consideration on account of various Discounts, Rebates, incentives offered by
  the Company as a part of the contract.
</p>

<p>
  The Company recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future
  economic benefits will flow to the entity.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Sale of goods</b><br />
  Revenue from sale of products is recognised when the significant risks and rewards in respect of ownership of products
  are transferred by the Company as well as the controls on the goods have been transferred to the customer. The
  performance obligation in case of sale of product is satisfied at a point in time i.e., when the material is shipped
  to the customers or on delivery to the customers, as may be specified in the contract.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Export Benefits</b><br />
  Export Incentives under prevalent schemes under EXIM policy/ Foreign Trade Policy are accounted once received by
  Company from the Government. Consumption of Raw Materials is arrived at after adjusting the difference between the
  cost of indigenous/duty paid imported raw materials and international cost of raw materials entitled to be
  imported/imported under Duty Exemption Scheme of the Government of India against direct/indirect exports made/to be
  made by the Company during the year.
</p>

<p>
  Government grants relating to the purchase of property, plant and equipment are included in non-current liabilities as
  deferred income and are credited to Profit and Loss on a systematic basis as and when export obligation are fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Dividend income</b><br />
  Dividend is recognised as revenue when the right to receive payment has been established.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Interest income</b><br />
  For all interest bearing financial assets measured at amortised cost, interest income is recorded using the effective
  interest rate (EIR). EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash receipts over the expected life
  of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial
  asset.
</p>

<p>
  <b><span style='color: #009900'>(e) Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE)</span></b>
</p>

<ol type='i'>
  <li>
    <b>Recognition and measurement</b><br />
    Freehold land is carried at historical cost. All other items of PPE are measured at cost less accumulated
    depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses, if any.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The cost of an item of PPE comprises:</p>

<ol type='a'>
  <li>
    its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, after deducting trade discounts and
    rebates.
  </li>
  <li>
    any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable
    of operating in the manner intended by management.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Income and expenses related to the incidental operations, not necessary to bring the item to the location and
  condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management, are recognised in profit
  or loss.
</p>

<p>
  The Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all its property, plant and equipment as recognised in
  the standalone financial statements as at the date of transition to Ind AS, measured as per the previous GAAP and use
  that as the deemed cost as at the transition date pursuant to the exemption under Ind AS 101.
</p>

<p>Any gain or loss on disposal of an item of PPE is recognised in profit and loss.</p>

<ol start='2' type='i'>
  <li>
    <b>Subsequent expenditure</b><br />
    Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future economic benefits associated with the
    expenditure will flow to the Company.

</p>

<h3>iii. Depreciation</h3>
<p>
  Depreciable amount for assets is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its estimated
  residual value.
</p>
<p>
  Depreciation on PPE has been provided based on useful life of the assets in accordance with Schedule II to the
  Companies Act, 2013, on Straight Line Method.
</p>
<p>
  Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if
  appropriate.
</p>
<p>
  Profit and loss on disposals are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount. These are included in the
  statement of profit and loss.

<p><b>(f) Investment properties</b></p>
<p>
  Property that is held for long-term rental yields or for capital appreciation or both, and that is not occupied by the
  Company, is classified as investment property. Investment property is measured initially at its cost, including
  related transaction costs and where applicable borrowing costs. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised to the asset’s
  carrying amount only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to
  the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance costs are expensed
  when incurred. When part of an investment property is replaced, the carrying amount of the replaced part is
  derecognised.
</p>
<p>Investment properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.</p>

<p><b>(g) Intangible assets</b></p>
<p>
  Intangible assets comprise application software purchased, which are not an integral part of the related hardware, and
  are amortised on a straight line basis over a period of useful life, which in Management’s estimate represents the
  period during which the economic benefits will be derived from their use.
</p>
<p>
  Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific to
  which it relates.
</p>
<p>
  The Company has elected to continue with the carrying value of all its intangible assets as recognised in the
  standalone financial statements as at the date of transition to Ind AS, measured as per the previous GAAP and use that
  as the deemed cost as at the transition date pursuant to the exemption under Ind AS 101

<p><b>(h) Impairment of non-financial assets</b></p>
<p>
  Assets that have a definite useful life are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
  that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Management periodically assesses using, external and internal
  sources, whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
</p>
<p>
  The recoverable amount is higher of the asset’s net selling price or value in use, which means the present value of
  future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of the asset and its eventual disposal. An impairment loss
  for an asset is reversed if, and only if, the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the
  impairment loss was recognised. The carrying amount of an asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount,
  provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined (net of any accumulated
  amortisation or depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.

<p>
  <b>(i) <span style='color: green'>Borrowing cost</span></b
  ><br />
  General and specific borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of
  a qualifying asset are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for
  its intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready
  for their intended use or sale.<br />
  Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying
  assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.<br />
  Other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs consist of interest and
  other costs that an entity incurs in connection with borrowing of funds. Borrowing cost also includes exchange
  difference to the extent regarded as an adjustment to the borrowing costs.
</p>

<p>
  <b>(j) <span style='color: green'>Lease</span></b
  ><br />
  The Company evaluates if an arrangement qualifies to be a lease as per the requirements of Ind AS 116. Identification
  of a lease requires significant judgment. The Company uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term
  (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate. The Company determines the lease term as the
  non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company
  is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company
  is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise
  an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and
  circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Company to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to
  exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Company revises the lease term if there is a change in the
  non-cancellable period of a lease. The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to
  the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.<br />
  Leasehold land is amortised over the lease period.

<p>
  <b>(k) <span style='color: green'>Income Tax</span></b
  ><br />
  Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. It is recognised in profit and loss except to the extent that
  it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in OCI.
</p>

<p>
  <b>i. Current tax</b><br />
  Current tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any
  adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax rates enacted or
  substantively enacted at the reporting date. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with
  respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where
  appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.<br />
  Current tax assets and liabilities are offset only if:
</p>
<ol type='a'>
  <li>
    there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they
    relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority; and
  </li>
  <li>
    there is intention either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  <b>ii. Deferred tax</b><br />
  Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
  for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. However, deferred tax liabilities are not
  recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it
  arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at
  the time of the transaction affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit (tax loss).<br />
  Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses, unused tax credits and deductible temporary differences (if
  any) to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used.
  Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable
  that the related tax benefit will be realised; such reductions are reversed when
</p>
<hr />
<h2><b>Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements</b></h2>
<p>
  <i>for the year ended 31<sup>st</sup> March, 2025</i>
</p>

<p>
  the probability of future taxable profits improves. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting
  date and recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will be available against
  which they can be used.
</p>
<p>
  Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to temporary differences when they reverse,
  using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related
  deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
</p>
<p>
  Deferred tax liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of
  investments in subsidiaries where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary
  differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
</p>
<p>
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only if they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation
  authority on the same taxable entity.
</p>

<p>
  <b>(l) Cash and cash equivalents</b><br />
  For the purpose of presentation in the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, call
  deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are
  readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
</p>

<p>
  <b>(m) Inventories</b><br />
  Raw materials, packing materials and stores, work in progress, traded and finished goods are stated at the lower of
  cost and net realisable value, cost is calculated on moving weighted average basis.
</p>
<p>
  In respect of finished goods, cost includes materials, appropriate share of utilities, other overheads and applicable
  excise duty. Cost of inventories comprises all costs of purchase, costs of conversion and other costs incurred in
  bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
</p>
<p>
  Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of
  completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
</p>

<p>
  <b>(n) Research and development</b><br />
  Revenue expenditure on Research and Development is charged to Profit and Loss Account as incurred. Capital expenditure
  on assets acquired for Research and Development is added to PPE.
</p>

<p>
  <b>(o) Financial instruments</b><br />
  A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or
  equity instrument of another entity. Financial instruments also include derivative contracts such as foreign currency
  foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and currency options; and embedded derivatives in the host
  contract.
</p>

<p>
  <b>i. Financial assets</b><br />
  <b>Classification</b><br />
  The Company shall classify financial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost, fair value through other
  comprehensive income (FVTOCI) or fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) on the basis of its business model for
  managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Initial recognition and measurement</b><br />
  All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair
  value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial assets.
  However, trade receivables that do not contain a significant financing component are measured at transaction price.
  Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation
  or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the
  Company commits to purchase or sell the assets.
</p>
<hr />

<p>
  <b>for the year ended 31<sup>st</sup> March, 2025</b>
</p>

<h3>Debt instruments</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:
    <ol type='a'>
      <li>
        The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash
        flows, and
      </li>
      <li>
        Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal
        and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
    interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium and fees or
    costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the profit and
    loss.
  </li>
  <li>
    Debt instruments included within the fair value through profit and loss (FVTPL) category are measured at fair value
    with all changes recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Equity instruments</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    The Company subsequently measures all equity investments in companies other than equity investments in subsidiaries,
    at fair value. Where the Company’s management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity
    investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to
    profit or loss. Dividends from such investments are recognised in profit and loss as other income when the Company’s
    right to receive payments is established.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>De-recognition</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Company of similar financial
    assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company’s balance sheet) when:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or</li>
    <li>
      The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay
      the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and
      either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company
      has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred
      control of the asset.
    </li>
    <li>
      When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through
      arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has
      neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control
      of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company’s continuing
      involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the
      associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has
      retained.
    </li>
    <li>
      Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of
      the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Company could be
      required to repay.
    </li>
  </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Impairment of financial assets</h3>
<p>
  In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of
  impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:
</p>
<ol type='a'>
  <li>
    Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities,
    deposits, and bank balance
  </li>
  <li>
    Trade receivables - The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit
    risk. Rather, it recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime ECLs at each reporting date, right from its
    initial recognition.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3><b>ii. Financial liabilities</b></h3>
<h4>Classification</h4>
<p>
  The Company classifies all financial liabilities as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for financial
  liabilities at fair value through profit and loss. Such liabilities, including derivatives that are liabilities, shall
  be subsequently measured at fair value.
</p>
<hr />
<h2><b>Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements</b></h2>
<p>
  <i>for the year ended 31<sup>st</sup> March, 2025</i>
</p>

<h3>Initial recognition and measurement</h3>
<p>
  Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or
  loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as
  appropriate.
</p>
<p>
  All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and
  payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.
</p>
<p>
  The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including bank overdrafts,
  and derivative financial instruments.
</p>

<h3>Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss</h3>
<p>
  Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss include financial liabilities held for trading and
  financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit and loss. Financial
  liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term.
  This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as
  hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.
</p>
<p>Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the profit and loss.</p>
<p>
  Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit and loss are designated at the
  initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as
  FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains/loss are
  not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within
  equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The
  Company has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.
</p>

<h3>Loans and borrowings</h3>
<p>
  After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the
  EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognised.
</p>
<p>
  Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are
  an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.
</p>
<p>This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.</p>

<h3>De-recognition</h3>
<p>
  A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
  When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or
  the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the
  derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective
  carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.
</p>

<h3>Offsetting of financial instruments</h3>
<p>
  Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet where there is a
  legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or
  realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on
  future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or
  bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty.
</p>

<h3>Derivative financial instruments</h3>
<p>
  The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure
  to foreign exchange risks. For contracts where hedge accounting is not followed, such derivative financial instruments
  are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
  re-measured at fair value through profit and loss. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is
  positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.

  <li>
    <b>Hedge accounting</b><br />
    Forward exchange contracts entered to hedge highly probable forecast revenues are recorded using the principles of
    hedge accounting as per Ind AS 109. Such forward exchange contracts which qualify for cash flow hedge accounting and
    where the conditions of Ind AS 109 have been met are initially measured at fair value and are re-measured at
    subsequent reporting dates. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives that are designated and effective as
    hedges of the future cash flows are recognised directly under shareholder’s funds in the cash flow hedging reserve
    and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit and loss.<br /><br />
    At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Company formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to
    which the Company wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking
    the hedge. The documentation includes the Company’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge,
    the hedging/economic relationship, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, hedge ratio
    and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument’s fair value in offsetting the
    exposure to changes in the hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are
    expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows and are assessed on an
    ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods
    for which they were designated.<br /><br />
    Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated or exercised or no
    longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in shareholders’
    funds is transferred to statement of profit and loss when the forecasted transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction
    is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in shareholders’ funds is transferred to
    the statement of profit and loss.
  </li>
</ol>

<p><b>(p) Employee benefits</b></p>

<ol type='i'>
  <li>
    <b>Short-term employee benefits</b><br />
    Short-term employee benefits consisting of wages, salaries, social security contributions, ex-gratia and accrued
    leave, are benefits payable and recognised in 12 months. Short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in
    exchange for the services rendered by employees are recognised undiscounted during the year as the related service
    are rendered by the employee.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Defined contribution plans</b><br />
    Company’s contribution for the year paid/payable to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged to
    Statement of Profit and Loss.<br /><br />
    The Company’s contribution towards provident fund, superannuation fund and employee state insurance scheme for
    certain eligible employees are considered to be defined contribution plan for which the Company made contribution on
    monthly basis.
  </li>

  <li>
    <b>Defined benefit plans</b><br />
    Company’s liabilities towards defined benefit plans and other long-term benefits viz. gratuity and compensated
    absences expected to occur after twelve months, are determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method. Actuarial
    valuations under the Projected Unit Credit Method are carried out at the balance sheet date. Actuarial gains and
    losses are recognised in the Statement of other comprehensive income in the period of occurrence of such gains and
    losses. The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the
    defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of
    scheme assets, if any.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  <b>(q) Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets</b><br />
  A provision is recognised if as a result of a past event, the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive)
  that can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the
  obligation. Provisions are recognised at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present
  obligation at the balance sheet date. If the effect of time value of money is material, provisions are discounted
  using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.<br /><br />
  The Company records a provision for decommissioning costs towards site restoration activity. Decommissioning costs are
  provided at the present value of future expenditure using a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to fulfil
  decommissioning obligations and are recognised as part of the cost of the underlying assets.
</p>
<hr />
<h2><b>Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements</b></h2>
<p>
  <i>for the year ended 31<sup>st</sup> March, 2025</i>
</p>
<p>
  Any change in the present value of the expenditure, other than unwinding of discount on the provision, is reflected as
  adjustment to the provision and the corresponding asset. The change in the provision due to the unwinding of discount
  is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
</p>
<p>
  A contingent liability exists when there is a possible but not probable obligation, or a present obligation that may,
  but probably will not, require an outflow of resources, or a present obligation whose amount cannot be estimated
  reliably. Contingent liabilities do not warrant provisions but are disclosed unless the possibility of outflow of
  resources is remote. Where an inflow of economic benefits is probable, the Company shall disclose a brief description
  of the nature of the contingent assets at the year end and wherever practicable, an estimate of their financial
  effect.
</p>
<p>
  <b>(r)</b> <b>Earnings per share (EPS)</b><br />
  Basic EPS is computed using the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is
  computed using the weighted average number of equity and dilutive equity equivalent shares outstanding during the
  period except where the results would be anti-dilutive.
</p>
<p>
  <b>(s)</b> <b>Current vs non-current classification</b><br />
  The Company presents assets and liabilities in the balance sheet based on current/ non-current classification.
</p>
<p>An asset is treated as current when it is:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in normal operating cycle</li>
  <li>Held primarily for the purpose of trading</li>
  <li>Expected to be realised within twelve months after the reporting period, or</li>
  <li>
    Cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve
    months after the reporting period
  </li>
</ul>
<p>All other assets are classified as non-current.</p>
<p>A liability is current when:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is expected to be settled in normal operating cycle</li>
  <li>It is held primarily for the purpose of trading</li>
  <li>It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period, or</li>
  <li>
    There is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the
    reporting period
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The Company classifies all other liabilities as non-current.</p>
<p>Deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified as non-current assets and liabilities.</p>
<p>
  The operating cycle is the time between the acquisition of assets for processing and their realisation in cash and
  cash equivalents. The Company has identified twelve months as its operating cycle.
</p>
<p>
  <b>(t)</b> <b>Key estimates and assumptions</b><br />
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with Ind AS requires use of estimates and assumptions for some
  items, which might have an effect on their recognition and measurement in the balance sheet and statement of profit
  and loss. The actual amounts realised may differ from these estimates.
</p>
<p><b>Estimates and assumptions are required in particular for:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Determination of the estimated useful lives of tangible assets and intangible assets and the assessment as to which
    components of the cost may be capitalised.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Useful lives of tangible assets and intangible assets are based on the life prescribed in Schedule II of the Companies
  Act, 2013. In cases, where the useful lives are different from that prescribed in Schedule II, they are based on
  management estimate, taking into account the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating
  conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturers’ warranties and
  maintenance support. Assumptions also need to be made, when the Company assesses, whether an asset may be capitalised
  and which components of the cost of the asset may be capitalised.
</p>
<hr />
<h2><b>Notes forming part of the Standalone Financial Statements</b></h2>
<p>
  <b>for the year ended 31<sup>st</sup> March, 2025</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Recognition and measurement of defined benefit obligations</b><br />
    The obligation arising from defined benefit plan is determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions. Key actuarial
    assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary escalation and vested future benefits and life expectancy. The
    discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.
    The period to maturity of the underlying bonds correspond to the probable maturity of the post-employment benefit
    obligations.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Provisions and contingent liabilities</b><br />
    The Company exercises judgment in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities
    related to pending litigation or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration
    or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities. Judgment is necessary in assessing the likelihood
    that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the financial
    settlement. Because of the inherent uncertainty in this evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the
    originally estimated provision.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Measurement of fair values</b><br />
    The Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and
    non-financial assets and liabilities. The Company has an established control framework with respect to the
    measurement of fair values. The finance team has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value
    measurements, including Level 3 fair values, and reports directly to the CFO.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  They regularly review significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information is used to
  measure fair values then the finance team assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the
  conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in
  which such valuations should be classified.
</p>

<p>
  When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company uses observable market data as far as possible.
  Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation
  techniques as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.</li>
  <li>
    Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either
    directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
  </li>
  <li>
    Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value
  hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value
  hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.
</p>

  <b><u>(u) Recent pronouncements</u></b
  ><br />
  Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies
  (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. During the year ended 31<sup>st</sup> March, 2025,

  The company offsets tax assets and liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current
  tax assets and current tax liabilities and the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes
  levied by the same tax authority.
</p>
<p>
  Significant management judgement is required in determining provision for income tax, deferred income tax assets and
  liabilities and recoverability of deferred income tax assets. The recoverability of deferred income tax assets is
  based on estimates of taxable income in which the relevant entity operates and the period over which deferred income
  tax assets will be recovered.

  Fair values for financial instruments carried at amortised cost approximates the carrying amount, accordingly the fair
  values of such financial assets and financial liabilities have not been disclosed separately.

<h3><b>B. Measurement of fair values</b></h3>
<p>
  Ind AS 107, ‘Financial Instrument - Disclosure’ requires classification of the valuation method of financial
  instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, using a three level fair-value-hierarchy (which reflects the
  significance of inputs used in the measurements). The hierarchy gives the highest priority to un-adjusted quoted
  prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to
  un-observable inputs (Level 3 measurements). Fair value of derivative financial assets and liabilities are estimated
  by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing market interest rate curves. The three levels
  of the fair-value-hierarchy under Ind AS 107 are described below:
</p>

<p><b>Level 1:</b> Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices.</p>
<p>
  <b>Level 2:</b> The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using
  valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity
  specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is
  included in level 2.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Level 3:</b> If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is
  included in level3.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Transfers between Levels</b><br />
  There have been no transfers between Levels during the reporting periods

  <b>C. Financial risk management</b><br />
  The Company has exposure to the following risks arising from financial instruments:<br />
  • Credit risk;<br />
  • Liquidity risk; and<br />
  • Market risk
</p>

<p>
  <b>i. Risk management framework</b><br />
  The Company’s board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk
  management framework. The board of directors is responsible for developing and monitoring the Company risk management
  policies.<br />
  The Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set
  appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and
  systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company’s activities. The Company,
  through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control
  environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.<br />
  The audit committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the company’s risk management policies and
  procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company.
  The audit committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad
  hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the audit committee.
</p>

<p>
  <b>ii. Credit risk</b><br />
  Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails
  to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and
  investments in debt securities, cash and cash equivalents, mutual funds, bonds, etc.<br />
  The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Trade and other receivables</b><br />
  Around 71% of the sales are export sales. For major part of the sales, customer credit risk is managed by requiring
  domestic and export customers to pay advances before transfer of ownership, therefore substantially eliminating the
  Company’s credit risk in this respect.<br />
  Based on prior experience and an assessment of the current economic environment, management believes that no provision
  is required for credit risk wherever credit is extended to customers.

<h3><b>NOTE NO. 39 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS – FAIR VALUES AND RISK MANAGEMENT (Contd.)</b></h3>
<p>
  <i
    >*Guarantees issued by the company on behalf of subsidiaries are with respect to borrowings raised by the respective
    entities. These amounts will be payable on default by the concerned entity. As of the reporting date, none of the
    subsidiaries have defaulted and hence, the company does not have any present obligation to third parties in relation
    to such guarantees.</i

</p>
<p>
  The inflows/(outflows) disclosed in the above table represent the contractual undiscounted cash flows relating to
  derivative financial liabilities held for risk management purposes and which are not usually closed out before
  contractual maturity. The disclosure shows net cash flow amounts for derivatives that are net cash-settled and gross
  cash inflow and outflow amounts for derivatives that have simultaneous gross cash settlement.
</p>

<p>
  <b>iv. Market risk</b><br />
  Market risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash flows that may result from adverse
  changes in market rates and prices (such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates) or in the price of market
  risk-sensitive instruments as a result of such adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk is attributable
  to all market risk-sensitive financial instruments, all foreign currency receivables and payables and all short-term
  and long-term debt. The Company is exposed to market risk primarily related to foreign exchange rate risk, interest
  rate risk and the market value of its investments. Thus, the Company’s exposure to market risk is a function of
  investing and borrowing activities and revenue generating and operating activities in foreign currencies.
</p>

<p>
  <b>a) Currency risk</b><br />
  The company is exposed to currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales,
  purchase, other expenses and borrowings are denominated and the functional currency of the company. The functional
  currency of the company is Indian Rupees (₹). The currencies in which these transactions are primarily denominated are
  EURO and USD.
</p>
<p>
  At any point in time, the Company generally hedges its estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecast
  sales/purchases over the forthcoming financial years in advance. The Company uses forward exchange contracts to hedge
  its currency risk. Such contracts are generally designated as cash flow hedges.
</p>
<p>
  The Company, as per its risk management policy, uses foreign exchange forward contract and cross currency forward
  contracts primarily to hedge foreign exchange. The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading
  or speculative purposes.

<p>
  <b>Interest rate sensitivity - fixed rate instruments</b><br />
  The company's fixed rate borrowings are carried at amortised cost. They are therefore not subject to interest rate
  risk as defined in IND AS 107, since neither the carrying amount nor the future cash flow will fluctuate because of a
  change in market interest rates.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Interest rate sensitivity - variable rate instruments</b><br />
  A reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/
  decreased equity and profit or loss by amounts shown below. This analyses assumes that all other variables, in
  particular, foreign currency exchange rates, remain constant. This calculation also assumes that the change occurs at
  the balance sheet date and has been calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date. The period end
  balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.

<h3>NOTE NO. 40 HEDGE ACCOUNTING</h3>

<p>
  As part of its risk management strategy, the company endeavours to hedge its net foreign currency exposure of highly
  forecasted sale transactions for the forthcoming financial years in advance. The company uses forward contracts to
  hedge its currency exposure. Such contracts are designated as cash flow hedges.
</p>

<p>
  The forward contracts are generally denominated in the same currency in which the sales realisation is likely to take
  place.
</p>

<p>
  For derivative contracts designated as hedge, the Company documents, at inception, the economic relationship between
  the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the hedge ratio, the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge
  and the methods used to assess the hedge effectiveness.
</p>

<p>
  Financial contracts designated as hedges are accounted for in accordance with the requirements of Ind AS 109 depending
  upon the type of hedge.
</p>

<p>
  The Company applies cash flow hedge accounting to hedge the variability in the future cash flows attributable to
  foreign exchange risk.
</p>

<p>
  Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. The Company
  assesses hedge effectiveness both on prospective and retrospective basis. The prospective hedge effectiveness test is
  a forward looking evaluation of whether or not the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging position are
  expected to be highly effective on offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged position over
  the term of the relationship. On the other hand, the retrospective hedge effectiveness test is a backward-looking
  evaluation of whether the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging position have been highly effective
  in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged position since the date of designation of the
  hedge.
</p>

<p>
  Hedge effectiveness is assessed through the application of critical terms match method. Any ineffectiveness in a
  hedging relationship is accounted for in the statement of profit and loss.
</p>

<p>The company has formally designated and documented hedge relationship from 1<sup>st</sup> April, 2016.</p>

<h4><b>(A) Defined Contribution Plan</b></h4>
<p>
  The Company has various schemes for long-term benefits such as provident fund and superannuation. In case of funded
  schemes, the funds are recognised by the Income tax authorities and administered by appropriate authorities. The
  Company's defined contribution plans are superannuation and employees' pension scheme (under the provisions of the
  Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952) since the Company has no further obligation beyond
  making the contributions. The liability of the Company on the exempt Provident Fund is restricted to the interest

<h4><b>(B) Defined Benefit Plan</b></h4>
<p>
  In accordance with the provisions of the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972, the Company has a defined benefit plan which
  provides for gratuity payments. The plan provides a lump sum gratuity payment to eligible employees at retirement or
  termination of their employment. The amounts are based on the respective employee's last drawn salary and the years of
  employment with the Company.
</p>
<p>
  Liabilities in respect of the gratuity plan are determined by an actuarial valuation, based upon which the Company
  makes annual contributions to the Group Gratuity cum Life Assurance Schemes administered by the LIC of India, a funded
  defined benefit plan for qualifying employees.
</p>
<p>
  The most recent actuarial valuation of the defined benefit obligation along with the fair valuation of the plan assets
  in relation to the gratuity scheme was carried out as at 31<sup>st</sup> March, 2025. The present value of the defined
  benefit obligations and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the Projected Unit
  Credit Method.

  The above sensitivity analyses have been calculated to show the movement in defined benefit obligation in isolation
  and assuming there are no other changes in market conditions at the reporting date. In practice, generally it does not
  occur. When we change one variable, it affects to others. In calculating the sensitivity, project unit credit method
  at the end of the reporting period has been applied.

<h2>NOTES ANNEXED TO AND FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE BALANCE SHEET AS AT MARCH 31, 2024</h2>
<h3>Note 3 : Property, Plant and Equipment and Right -of-Use Assets</h3>
<h4>Accounting policy</h4>
<p>
  Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment
  losses, if any. The cost comprises purchase price, including import duties and non- refundable purchase taxes,
  borrowing costs, if recognition criteria are met and any directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its
  working condition for the intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase
  price.
</p>
<p>
  Subsequent expenditure related to an item of PPE is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits
  associated with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Such cost includes
  the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment. When significant parts of plant and equipment are required to
  be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when
  a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a
  replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the
  Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred.
</p>
<p>
  Items of stores and spares that meet the definition of PPE are capitalized at cost. Otherwise, such items are
  classified as inventories.
</p>
<p>
  Catalysts which are used in commissioning of new plant are capitalized and are amortized based on the estimated useful
  life as technically assessed. Subsequent issues of catalysts, if any, are treated as inventory.
</p>
<p>
  Gains or losses arising from derecognition of the assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal
  proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is
  derecognized.
</p>
<p>
  Depreciation on PPE is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost, net of their residual values,
  over their useful lives estimated by the management based on technical evaluation, which are equal to the useful life
  prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, other than the cases as mentioned in table below from S.No.
  (i) to (vi), where the useful lives are different from those prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. The
  management believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over
  which the assets are likely to be used. A major portion of the plant and equipment of the Company has been considered
  as continuous process plant.
</p>
<p>The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:</p>

<p>
  <b>Note 4A : Other Intangible Assets</b><br />
  <b>Accounting policy</b><br />
  Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. Following initial recognition,
  intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any.
  Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic life.
  Software is the acquired intangible asset.<br />
  Management of the Company assessed the useful life of software as finite and cost of software is amortized over its
  estimated useful life of five years on straight line basis.<br />
  The amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at
  least at the end of each reporting period. If the expected useful life of the asset is significantly different from
  previous estimates, the amortization period is changed accordingly. If there has been a significant change in the
  expected pattern of economic benefits from the asset, the amortization method is changed to reflect the changed
  pattern. Such changes are accounted for in accordance with Ind AS-8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
  Estimates and Errors”.<br />
  Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net
  disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the
  asset is derecognized.

      <b>Accounting Policy</b><br />
      <b>Contract Assets</b><br />
      A contract asset is the right to consideration in exchange for goods or services transferred to the customer. If
      the Company fulfils its performance obligation by transferring goods or services to a customer before the customer
      pays consideration or before payment is due, a contract asset is recognised for the earned consideration that is
      conditional.<br />
      <b>Trade Receivables</b><br />
      A receivable represents the company’s right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional (i.e., only the
      passage of time is required before payment of the consideration is due).<br />

<h2>Note 12 : Long Term Provisions</h2>
<h3>Provision for Employee Benefits</h3>
<h4>Accounting Policy</h4>
<p>
  A provision is recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past event,
  it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and
  a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material,
  provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the
  liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a
  finance cost.

<p><b>Note 17 : Revenue from Operations</b></p>
<p><b>Accounting Policy</b></p>
<p>
  <b>Revenue recognition</b><br />
  Revenue from contracts with customers is recognised when control of the goods or services are transferred to the
  customer at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for
  those goods or services. The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements
  because it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer. In determining the
  transaction price for the sale of goods, the Company considers the effects of variable consideration, the existence of
  significant financing components, noncash consideration, and consideration payable to the customer (if any).<br />
  <b>Sale of Goods</b><br />
  Revenue, including subsidy, in respect of sale of goods is recognised at a point in time when control of the goods has
  transferred, being when the goods are delivered to the buyer, the buyer has full discretion over the goods and there
  is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the buyer’s acceptance of the goods. Revenue (other than subsidy) from
  the sales is recognised based on price specified in the contract, net of estimated volume discount. Amounts disclosed
  as revenue are net of returns and allowances, trade discounts, rebates and goods & services tax (GST). The Company
  collects GST on behalf of the government and therefore, these are not economic benefits flowing to the Company. Hence,
  these are excluded from the revenue.<br />
  The Company does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or
  services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Company does not adjust
  any of the transaction prices for the time value of money.<br />
  Subsidy on Urea including freight have been accounted on the basis of notified concession prices as under:<br />
  (i) New Pricing Scheme (NPS) – Stage III and Modified NPS III.<br />
  (ii) New Urea Policy 2015.<br />
  (iii) New Investment Policy 2012 (amended); and<br />
  (iv) Uniform Freight Policy.

  <b>Note 18 : Other Income</b><br />
  <b>Accounting Policy</b><br />
  (i) <b>Interest Income</b><br />
  Interest income is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to gross carrying amount of a financial asset
  except for financial asset that subsequently become credit impaired. In case of credit impaired financial asset, the
  effective interest rate is applied to the net carrying amount of the financial assets (after deduction of the loss
  allowance).<br />
  (ii) <b>Dividend Income</b><br />
  Dividend income is recognised when the Company’s right to receive the payment is established, which is generally when
  shareholders approve the dividend.<br />
  (iii) <b>Insurance Claims</b><br />
  Claims receivable on account of insurance are accounted for to the extent the Company is reasonably certain of their
  ultimate collection.

  The Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan. Benefit is being paid as under-

<ol type='A'>
  <li>
    In case of retirement or death of an employee while in service of the Company, the gratuity will be payable as
    under:
    <ol type='i'>
      <li>
        Completed continuous service of 5 years and above upto 20 years – gratuity equivalent to 15 days last drawn
        salary for each completed year of service.
      </li>
      <li>
        Completed continuous service of above 20 years – gratuity equivalent to 15 days last drawn salary for first 20
        years and 20 days last drawn salary for each completed year of service after 20 years.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    In case of resignation or termination of an employee, where the employee has completed 5 years of continuous service
    with the Company, gratuity equivalent to 15 days last drawn salary for each completed year of service shall be
    payable.<br />
    In case of erstwhile Shipping Division, the Company has a defined benefit gratuity plan. Every employee who has
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  (ii) Superannuation Fund is a defined contribution scheme. Liability in respect of Superannuation Fund to the
  concerned employees of the Company is accounted for as per the Company’s Scheme and contributed to concerned insurers
  every year. The Company does not have any other obligation, other than the contribution payable to the superannuation
  fund. The Company recognizes contribution payable to the superannuation fund scheme as an expenditure when an employee
  renders the related service. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the balance sheet
  date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognized as a liability.
</p>

<p>
  (iii) Gratuity liability is a defined benefit obligation and is provided for on the basis of an actuarial valuation on
  projected unit credit method made at the end of each financial year. Gratuity plan of the Company is funded with
  insurance companies to cover the gratuity liability of the employees. The difference between the actuarial valuation
  of the gratuity of employees at the year-end and the balance of funds with insurance companies is provided for as
  liability in the books.
</p>

<p>
  (iv) Retirement benefit in the form of post-retirement medical benefits is a defined benefit obligation of the Company
  and is provided for on the basis of actuarial valuation on projected unit credit method made at the end of each
  financial year.
</p>

<p>
  (v) Accumulated leaves, which are expected to be utilized within the next 12 months, are treated as short-term
  employee benefit. The Company measures the expected cost of such absences as the additional amount that it expects to
  pay as a result of the unused entitlement that has accumulated at the reporting date. The Company treats accumulated
  leaves expected to be carried forward beyond twelve months, as long-term employee benefit for measurement purposes.
  Such long-term compensated absences are provided for based on the actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit
  method at the year-end. The Company presents the entire leaves as a current liability in the balance sheet since it
  does not have an unconditional right to defer its settlement for 12 months after the reporting date.
</p>

<p>
  (vi) Long service awards are other long-term benefits accruing to all eligible employees, as per Company’s scheme. The
  cost of providing benefit under long service awards scheme is determined on the basis of actuarial valuation using the
  projected unit credit method at the reporting date. This is unfunded defined benefit scheme.
</p>

<p>
  (vii) Settlement allowance are other long-term benefits accruing to the eligible employees, as per Company’s scheme.
  The cost of providing benefit under settlement allowance is determined on the basis of actuarial valuation using the
  projected unit credit method at the reporting date. This is unfunded defined benefit scheme.
</p>

<p>
  The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows by
  reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds that have terms approximating to the
  terms of the related obligation.
</p>

<p>
  The net interest cost is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net balance of the defined benefit obligation
  and the fair value of plan assets. This cost is included in employee benefits expense in the Statement of Profit and
  Loss.
</p>

<p>
  Re-measurement gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are
  recognised in the period in which they occur, directly in other comprehensive income and such re-measurement gain /
  (loss) are not reclassified to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the subsequent periods. They are included in
  retained earnings in the Statement of Changes in Equity.

        Sensitivities due to mortality &amp; withdrawals are not material and hence impact of change is not
        calculated.<br />
        Sensitivities as to rate of inflation, rate of increase of pension payment, rate of increase of pensions before
        retirement &amp; life expectancy are not applicable being a lump sum benefit on retirement.<br />
        The sensitivity analysis above have been determined based on a method that extrapolates the impact on defined
        benefit obligation as a result of reasonable changes in key assumptions occurring at the end of the reporting
        period.<br />
        The weighted average duration of the defined benefit plan obligation at the end of the reporting period is 14.70
        years for Gratuity Plan and 14.64 years for Post Retirement Medical Benefits Plan (Previous Year : 14.70 years
        for Gratuity Plan and 14.70 years for Post Retirement Medical Benefits Plan).

<h2>32 Leases</h2>
<h3>Accounting Policy</h3>
<h4>Company as a lessee:</h4>
<p>
  Leases are recognised as a Right-of-Use asset and a corresponding liability at the date at which the leased asset is
  available for use by the Company. Assets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present
  value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable.</li>
  <li>Variable lease payments.</li>
  <li>Amount expected to be payable by the Company under residual value guarantees, if any.</li>
  <li>the exercise price of a purchase option if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option, and</li>
  <li>
    payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the Company exercising that option.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Right-of-Use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The amount of initial measurement of lease liability.</li>
  <li>Any lease payment made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentive received.</li>
  <li>Any initial direct cost and restoration cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Payments associated with short-term leases of equipment and all leases of low-value assets are recognised on a
  straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or
  less. Low-value assets comprise Information technology / Computer equipment and small items of office furniture.
</p>
<p>
  This note provides information for the leases where the Company is a lessee. The Company leases various offices and
  lease periods are generally fixed ranging from eleven months to nine years, but may have extension options.

  The expected volatility was determined based on historical volatility data. For calculating volatility, the Company
  has considered the daily volatility of the stock prices of the Company on National Stock Exchange of India Limited
  over a period prior to the date of grant, corresponding with the expected life of the options.<br />
  In financial year 2010-11, CFCL Employees Welfare Trust (“Trust”) was constituted, inter alia, for the purpose of
  subscribing or acquiring equity shares of the Company from the Company or Secondary market, to hold the shares and to
  allocate or transfer these shares to eligible employees of the Company from time to time on the terms and conditions
  specified under the Employees stock option scheme. The Board of Directors at its meeting held on May 08, 2010 had
  approved grant of financial assistance upto Rs. 30.00 Crore by the Company to Trust in such manner and on such terms
  as agreed between the trustee(s) of the Trust and Managing Director of the Company for the purpose of subscribing or
  acquiring shares of the Company. During the current financial year all the outstanding options have been exercised,
  accordingly Trust is holding Nil equity shares (Previous Year : 68,000 equity shares) of the Company.

<h3>Income Tax Expense</h3>

<h4>Accounting Policy</h4>

<p>
  Tax expense or credit comprises of current income tax and deferred tax. Current income-tax expense or credit is
  measured at the amount expected to be paid to the taxation authorities in accordance with the Income-tax Act, 1961
  enacted in India. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount of current income tax are those that are
  enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date. Deferred Income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws)
  that have been enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related
  deferred income tax assets are realised, or the deferred income tax liabilities are settled.<br />
  Current income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in
  OCI or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or
  directly in equity.<br />
  Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and
  liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.<br />
  Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    When the deferred tax liability arises from an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business
    combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss;
    and
  </li>
  <li>
    In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interest in joint
    venture, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the
    temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
  </li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>
  Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits
  and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit
  will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and
  unused tax losses can be utilised.<br />
  The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no
  longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be
  utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent
  that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.<br />
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the
  asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or
  substantively enacted at the reporting date.<br />
  Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in OCI
  or in equity). Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or
  directly in equity.<br />
  Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are off-set if a legally enforceable right exists to set-off current
  tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same
  taxation authority.<br />
  Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in a year is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss as current tax. The Company
  recognizes MAT credit available as an asset only to the extent that there is convincing evidence that the Company will
  pay normal income tax during the specified period, i.e., the period for which MAT credit is allowed to be carried
  forward. In the year in which the Company recognizes MAT credit as an asset in accordance with the accounting
  framework and other applicable accounting pronouncements, the said asset is created by way of credit to the Statement
  of Profit and Loss and shown as “MAT Credit Entitlement” and grouped under Deferred Tax. The Company reviews the “MAT
  Credit Entitlement” asset at each reporting date and writes down the asset to the extent the Company does not have
  convincing evidence that it will pay normal tax during the specified period.<br />

  The Company has long term / short term capital losses, to the tune of Rs. 15.54 Crore (Previous Year: Rs. 104.86
  Crore) that are available for offsetting for one to four years against future taxable profits (long term / short term)
  of the Company. Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of above losses in the financial year 2023-24
  as there are no other tax planning opportunities or other evidence of recoverability in the near future.

<p>
  Non-Current Tax Assets of Rs. 138.64 Crore (net of provisions Rs. 585.67 Crore) [Previous Year : Rs. 131.86 Crore (net

</p>

<h3>37 Fair Values</h3>

<p>The management assessed that fair value of financial assets and liabilities approximates their carrying amount.</p>

<p>
  The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities is included at the amount at which the instrument could be
  exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
</p>

<p><b>The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:</b></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Derivative financial instruments - The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts is determined using the
    foreign exchange spot and forward rates at the balance sheet date. The derivatives are entered into with the banks /
    counterparties with investment grade credit ratings.
  </li>
  <li>
    Long term Security Deposits / Employee loans - The fair value of security deposits / employee loans approximates the
    carrying value and hence, the valuation technique and inputs have not been given.
  </li>
  <li>
    Floating Rate Borrowings / Lease Liabilities - The fair values of the Company’s interest bearing borrowings are
    determined by using discounted cash flow method using discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at
    the end of the reporting period. The own non-performance risk as at March 31, 2024 was assessed to be insignificant.
  </li>
  <li>
    The carrying amount of bank deposits, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, investment at amortised cost,
    other current financial assets, trade payables, fixed rate borrowings and other current financial liabilities are
    considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their short term nature.
  </li>
  <li>
    The fair value of investments carried at fair value through profit and loss is determined using Income Approach,
    Market Approach and Net Assets Value Method. Determining whether the investments in subsidiaries are impaired
    requires an estimate of the value in use of investments. In considering the value in use, the management anticipates
    the future growth rates, discount rates and other factors of the underlying businesses.
  </li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2>Fair Value Measurements</h2>
<h3>Accounting Policy</h3>
<h3>Derivative Financial Instruments</h3>
<h4>Initial Recognition and Subsequent Measurement</h4>
<p>
  Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date of derivative contract and are subsequently re-measured
  at fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gains / losses are recognised in the Statement of
  Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event
  the timing of recognition in profit or loss / inclusion in the initial cost of non-financial asset depends on the
  nature of the hedging relationship and the nature of the hedged item. The Company complies with the principles of
  hedge accounting where derivative contracts are designated as hedge instruments. At the inception of the hedge
  relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item
  including whether the changes in the cash flows of the hedging instrument are expected to offset changes in the cash
  flows of hedged items, along with the risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking hedge transaction.
</p>
<p>
  The Company has designated certain derivatives as hedge of foreign exchange risk associated with the cash flows of
  highly probable forecast transactions with borrowings.
</p>
<h3>Financial Instruments</h3>
<p>
  A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or
  equity instrument of another entity.
</p>
<ol type='a'>
  <li><b>Financial assets</b></li>
</ol>
<h4>Initial Recognition and Measurement</h4>
<p>
  All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair
  value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.
  Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss.
  Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation
  or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the
  Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
</p>
<h4>Subsequent Measurement</h4>
<h5>Debt Instruments</h5>
<p>
  Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company’s business model for managing the asset and the cash
  flow characteristics of the asset. For the purposes of subsequent measurement, debt instruments are classified in the
  following three categories:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Debt instruments at amortised cost.</li>
  <li>Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI); and</li>
  <li>Debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Debt Instruments at amortised cost</h5>
<p>A debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:</p>
<ol type='a'>
  <li>
    The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows;
    and
  </li>
  <li>
    Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and
    interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
  interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition
  and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the
  profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss.
</p>
<h5>Debt Instruments at FVTOCI</h5>
<p>A debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:</p>
<ol type='a'>
  <li>
    The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial
    assets, and
  </li>
  <li>The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair
  value. Fair value movements are recognized in the OCI. However, the Company recognizes interest income, impairment
  losses &amp; reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On derecognition of the
  asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to the Statement of Profit
  and Loss. Interest earned while holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.
</p>
<hr />
<h2>Debt Instruments at FVTPL</h2>
<p>
  FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for
  categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. In addition, the Company may elect to
  designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such
  election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as
  ‘accounting mismatch’). Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all
  changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
</p>
<h3>Equity Instruments</h3>
<p>For the purposes of subsequent measurement, equity instruments are classified in two categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Equity instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); and</li>
  <li>Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)</li>
</ul>
<p>
  All equity investments are measured at fair value. The Company may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent
  changes in the fair value in OCI. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The
  classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. Equity instruments included within the FVTPL
  category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
</p>
<p>
  If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument,
  excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement of Profit
  and Loss, on derecognition, including sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or
  loss within equity.
</p>
<h3>Investment in Subsidiaries and Joint Venture</h3>
<p>
  Investment in subsidiaries and joint venture is carried at deemed cost in the separate financial statements, except in
  case of investment in preference shares (debt instrument) of a subsidiary company which is carried in accordance with
  Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’.
</p>
<h3>Derecognition</h3>
<p>
  A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets)
  is primarily derecognised when:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or</li>
  <li>
    The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the
    received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either
    (i) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (ii) the Company has
    neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control
    of the asset.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Impairment of Financial Assets</h3>
<p>
  The Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at
  amortised cost and FVTOCI debt instruments. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a
  significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. Assessment of such credit risk is being made on
  case-to-case basis based on available information.
</p>
<p>
  For trade receivables only, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 ‘Financial
  Instruments’, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.
</p>
<p>
  The allowance for doubtful debts/ advances or impairment of assets is made on case-to-case basis by considering
  relevant available information.
</p>
<p><b>(b) Financial Liabilities</b></p>
<h3>Initial recognition and measurement</h3>
<p>
  Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or
  loss, as loans and borrowings, as payables, or as derivatives. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at
  fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The
  Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including derivative financial
  instruments.
</p>
<h3>Subsequent Measurement</h3>
<p>The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:</p>
<h3>Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss</h3>
<p>
  Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) include financial liabilities held for trading and
  financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classified as held
  for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes
  derivative financial instruments entered by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge
  relationships as defined by Ind AS 109 ‘Financial instruments. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are
  recognised in the profit or loss.
</p>
<hr />
<h3>Loans and Borrowings</h3>
<p>
  Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently
  measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption /
  repayment amount is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest
  method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the
  extent that it is probable that some or all the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until
  the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all the facility will be
  drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the
  facility to which it relates.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Derecognition</b><br />
  A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
  When an existing financial liability is replaced by another financial liability on substantially different terms, or
  the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as
  de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective
  carrying amounts is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Offsetting of Financial Instruments</b><br />
  Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is
  a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net
  basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.

<p><b>(ii) Fair Value Hierarchy</b></p>
<p><b>Accounting Policy</b></p>
<p>The Company measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each reporting date</p>
<p>
  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
  transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the
  presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:<br />
  - In the principal market for the asset or liability, or<br />
  - In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability

<p>There have been no transfers between level 1, level 2 and level 3 fair value hierarchy during the period.</p>

<p>
  The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company.<br />
  The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when
  pricing the asset or liability and assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.<br />
  A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate
  economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that
  would use the asset in its highest and best use.<br />
  The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are
  available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of
  unobservable inputs.<br />
  All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised
  within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
  value measurement as a whole:<br />
  - Level 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.<br />
  - Level 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is
  directly or indirectly observable.<br />
  - Level 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is
  unobservable.<br />
  For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company
  determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on
  the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting
  period.<br />
  The Company’s management determines the policies and procedures for both recurring fair value measurement, such as
  derivative instruments and unquoted financial assets measured at fair value, and for non-recurring fair value
  measurement, such as assets held for disposal in discontinued operations.<br />
  External valuers are involved for valuation of significant assets, such as properties and unquoted financial assets,
  and significant liabilities, such as contingent consideration, if any.<br />
  At each reporting date, the management analyses the movements in the values of assets and liabilities which are
  required to be re-measured or re-assessed as per the Company’s accounting policies. For this analysis, the management
  verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by comparing the information in the valuation computation to
  contracts and other relevant documents.<br />
  The management, in conjunction with the Company’s external valuers and / or with available information, also compares
  the change in the fair value of each asset and liability with relevant available external sources to determine whether
  the change is reasonable.<br />
  For the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis
  of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as
  explained above.<br />
  This note summarises accounting policy for fair value. Other fair value related disclosures are given in the relevant
  notes.<br />
  The following table provides the Fair Value Measurement hierarchy of the Company’s Assets and Liabilities.<br />

<h3>39 Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies</h3>
<p>
  The Company’s principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprises of borrowings, trade payables and
  other financial liabilities. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance the Company’s operations.
  The Company’s principal financial assets include trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents which are
  derived directly from its operations. The Company also holds investments.<br />
  The Company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company’s senior management oversees the
  management of these risks. The management of these risks is carried out by the finance department under the approved
  policies of the Company. The finance department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation
  with the Company’s operating units. The management reviews overall risks periodically.
</p>
<p>
  <b>(i) Market Risk</b><br />
  Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of
  changes in market prices. Market risk comprises three types of risk: interest rate risk, currency risk and other price
  risk, such as commodity risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, investments, other
  receivables, other payables and derivative financial instruments. The sensitivity analysis in the following sections
  relate to the position as at March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023.<br />
  The sensitivity analysis have been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating
  interest rates of the debt and derivatives and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all
  constant.

        rate swap contracts for converting floating rate into fixed rate.<br />

        The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates on the

        <b>b) Foreign Currency Risk</b><br />
        Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure will fluctuate because
        of changes in foreign exchange rates. The foreign exchange risk of the Company arises mainly out of import of
        fertilisers and foreign currency borrowings.<br />
        The major part of the long term borrowings of the Company comprises of External Commercial Borrowings / Foreign
        Currency Term Loans availed in US Dollars for financing of Gadepan-III plant of the Company. The repayment of
        these loans has started from financial year 2019-20. The revenue of the Company from Gadepan-III Plant is linked
        to US Dollars in terms of New Investment policy 2012. Accordingly, the Company has natural cover against
        fluctuation of foreign exchange rates and did not enter into transactions to hedge foreign exchange risk in
        respect of aforesaid foreign currency borrowings.<br />

<p><b>Disclosure of effects of hedge accounting on Financial Position and Financial Performance:</b></p>
<p><b>Accounting Policy - Cash Flow Hedges</b></p>
<p>
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges
  is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated as ‘Cash Flow Hedging Reserve’. The gains / losses
  relating to the ineffective portion are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
</p>
<p>
  Amounts previously recognised and accumulated in Other Comprehensive Income are re-classified to profit or loss when
  the hedged item affects the Statement of Profit and Loss. However, when the hedged item results in the recognition of
  a non-financial asset, such gains / losses are transferred from equity (but not as re-classification adjustment) and
  included in the initial measurement cost of the non-financial asset.
</p>
<p>
  Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it
  no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gains / losses recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated
  in equity at that time remains in equity and is re-classified when the underlying transaction is ultimately
  recognised. When an underlying transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gains / losses accumulated in equity
  are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

<p><b>c) Commodity Price Risk</b></p>
<p>
  Commodity price risk of the Company arises from the ongoing purchase of natural gas and imported fertilisers required
  for its operating activities.
</p>
<ol type='i'>
  <li>
    Natural gas is the major raw material for manufacture of Urea. The prices of Natural Gas are mostly linked to
    international crude oil prices which varies with the fluctuation in the prices of crude oil, demand supply pattern
    etc. The part of the natural gas quantity required by the Company has also been purchased at fixed price. The cost
    of natural gas is considered appropriately in line with the subsidy policies of Government of India for manufacture
    of Urea. As per the guidelines for pooling of gas in fertilizer (Urea) sector issued by the Government of India, the
    natural gas is available to the Urea manufacturer at uniform price. The Company did not enter into any transaction
    for hedging the fluctuations in the prices of natural gas.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Company deals in imported fertilisers (i.e. DAP, MOP and NPK), which are imported by the Company and sold in the
    domestic market. The prices of imported fertilisers may fluctuate due to demand-supply scenario, outage of plants,
    fluctuation in prices of raw materials etc.<br />
    The Company takes following steps to mitigate the risk pertaining to fluctuation in prices:
    <ul>
      <li>Dynamic sourcing strategy and review of demand and supply on regular basis;</li>
      <li>No long term commitments; and</li>
      <li>Constant review of market condition including costing of competitors.</li>
    </ul>
    The Company did not enter into any transactions to hedge the risk pertaining to fluctuation in prices.
  </li>
</ol>
<p><b>(ii) Credit Risk</b></p>
<p>
  Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer
  contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily
  trade receivables) including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other
  financial instruments.
</p>
<p><b>a) Trade Receivables</b></p>
<p>
  The Company’s receivables can be classified into two categories, one is from the customers/ dealers in the market and
  second one is from the Government of India in the form of subsidy. As far as Government portion of receivables are
  concerned, credit risk is low. In respect of market receivables from the customers/ dealers, the Company extends
  credit to customers in normal course of business. The Company considers factors such as credit track record in the
  market and past dealings for extension of credit to customers. The Company monitors the payment track record of the
  customers and outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Company evaluates the concentration of
  risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several states and operate in largely
  independent markets. The Company has also taken security deposits from its customers, which mitigate the credit risk
  to some extent.
</p>
<p>
  For trade receivables only, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 ‘Financial
  Instruments’, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.
</p>
<p>
  The provision for doubtful debts or provision for impairment of trade receivables is made on case to case basis, based
  on the information available, past history and other relevant available information. The Company also makes general
  provision for credit loss based on its past experience of provision / write off.
</p>
<p>
  Assessment of credit risk is being made on case to case basis based on available information and if credit risk has
  increased from initial recognition.

  <b>(iii) Liquidity Risk</b><br />
  The Company’s objective is to maintain optimum levels of liquidity to meet its cash and collateral requirements at all
  times. The Company relies on a mix of borrowings and excess operating cash flows to meet its needs for funds. The
  current committed lines of credit are sufficient to meet its short to medium/ long term funding requirements. The
  Company monitors rolling forecasts of its liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational
  needs while maintaining sufficient headroom in its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that the
  Company does not breach borrowing limits or covenants (where applicable) on any of its borrowing facilities.<br />
  The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company’s financial liabilities based on contractual
  undiscounted payments.

  <b>42 Assets classified as Held for Sale</b><br />
  <b>Accounting Policy</b><br />
  Non-current assets (or disposal group) are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered
  principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use and a sale is considered highly probable.<br />
  Non-current assets held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell,
  except for assets such as deferred tax assets, assets arising from employee benefits, financial assets and contractual
  rights under insurance contracts, which are specifically exempt from this requirement.<br />
  An impairment loss is recognised for any initial or subsequent write-down of the asset (or disposal group) to fair
  value less costs to sell. A gain is recognised for any subsequent increases in fair value less costs to sell of an
  asset (or disposal group), but not in excess of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised. A gain or loss
  not previously recognised by the date of the sale of the non-current asset (or disposal group) is recognised at the
  date of de-recognition.<br />
  Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are not depreciated or
  amortised.<br />
  Discontinued operations is a component of an entity that either has been disposed off, or is classified as held for
  sale, and: represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single
  co-ordinated plan to dispose off a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations.<br />
  Non-current assets classified as held for sale and the assets of a disposal group classified as held for sale are
  presented separately from the other assets in the balance sheet. The liabilities of a disposal group classified as
  held for sale are presented separately from other liabilities in the balance sheet.

                Due to timely receipt of subsidy, lower natural gas prices, lower imported fertilisers prices and
                volume, working capital borrowings were very miniscule as compared to Previous Year, resulting into
                lower interest costs, though interest rates were higher during the year. On the other hand increase in
                USD / INR rate also resulted into increase in repayment obligation of the loan. In addition to above,
                performance of the Company has improved as compared to Previous Year, majorly due to no losses in
                imported fertilisers. All the above factors led to decrease in Interest costs and higher profits,
                resulting into higher debt service coverage ratio.

        The decrease in natural gas prices, lower volume of own manufactured fertilisers, decrease in prices and
        quantity of imported fertilisers contributed to around 35% decrease in turnover of the Company. The average
        debtors of the Company for the Financial Year 2023-24 were around 50% lower in comparison to the Previous Year
        on account of better collection and subsidy de-escalation due to lower gas prices. The Debtors’ Turnover Ratio
        has improved on account of the decrease in average debtors, which has been partly offset by the decrease in
        turnover.

        fertilisers. On the other hand, the performance of the Company has improved, and the finance costs are also

  <b>(xiv) Registration of charges or satisfaction with Registrar of Companies</b><br />
  There are no charges or satisfaction which are yet to be registered with the Registrar of Companies beyond the
  statutory period.
</p>

<p>
  <b>(xv) Utilisation of borrowings availed from banks and financial institutions</b><br />
  The borrowings obtained by the Company from banks and financial institutions have been applied for the purposes for
  which such loans were taken.
</p>

<h2>Significant Accounting Judgements, Estimates and Assumptions</h2>
<p>
  The preparation of the Company’s financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and
  assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, the accompanying
  disclosures and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could
  result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in
  future periods.
</p>

<p>
  <b>a) Property, Plant and Equipment</b><br />
  Property, Plant and Equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Company. The charge in
  respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the
  expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Company’s assets are
  determined by the management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial
  year end. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events,
  which may impact their life, such as changes in technical or commercial obsolescence arising from changes or
  improvements in production or from a change in market demand of the product or service output of the asset.
</p>

<p>
  <b>b) Income Taxes</b><br />
  Deferred Tax Assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be
  available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the
  amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable
  profits together with future tax planning strategies.<br />
  The Company has Rs. 15.54 Crore (Previous Year: Rs. 104.56 Crore) of carried forward tax losses on account of long
  term/ short term capital losses. These losses mainly relate to the loss on voluntary liquidation of a subsidiary of
  the Company and merger of a subsidiary of the Company with its subsidiary and will expire in one to four years and may
  be used to offset taxable long term / short term capital gains in the future. On this basis, the Company has
  determined that it cannot recognise deferred tax assets on these tax losses (long term/ short term capital losses)
  carried forward. If the Company would have been able to recognise all unrecognised deferred tax assets, profit and
  equity would have increased by Rs. 5.28 Crore (Previous Year: Rs.36.49 Crore). Further details on taxes are disclosed
  in note 36 to the financial statements.<br />
  The Government of India has introduced the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019 and has given the option of lower tax
  rate subject to certain conditions. As the Company has Minimum Alternate Tax (“MAT”) credit mainly due to addition of
  New Urea
</p>
<hr />
<section>
  <p>
    Plant in the past and it is expected that the Company will utilise entire MAT credit next year, the management has
    carried out an assessment according to which the Company shall continue under the existing tax regime and move to
    lower tax rate after next financial year. In view of above, the Company had re-assessed the deferred tax liability
    as per Ind AS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ and resultant impact if any has been recognised . Accordingly, the ‘Deferred Tax’
    for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 includes a credit of Nil (Previous Year: Rs. 83.90 Crore).
  </p>
  <p><b>c) Defined Benefit Plans</b></p>
  <p>
    The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan, post-employment medical benefits and other defined benefit plans and
    the present value of the obligation of defined benefit plans are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial
    valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include
    the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities
    involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in
    these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
  </p>
  <p>
    The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate for defined
    benefit plans, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds.
  </p>
  <p>
    The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables. Those mortality tables tend to change only at
    interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases are based on the expected future inflation
    rates. Further details about the defined benefit plans are given in note 30 to the financial statements.
  </p>
  <p><b>d) Revenue</b></p>
  <p>
    The Company’s revenue includes subsidy claims, part of which are pending notification / final implementation by
    ‘Fertiliser Industry Coordination Committee’ (FICC), Government of India. As per management estimates, there is
    reasonable certainty based on Government of India policy and past experience that claims will be notified in due
    course. On issuance of notification by FICC, Government of India, the adjustments, if any, to revenue are not
    expected to be significant.
  </p>
  <p><b>e) Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments</b></p>
  <p>
    When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured
    based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including
    discounted cash flow method. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets wherever possible, but
    where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. The judgements include
    considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these
    factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. Further disclosures in this regard are given
    in note 38.

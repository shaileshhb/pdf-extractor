  "<h2>NOTES ANNEXED TO AND FORMING PART OF THE STANDALONE BALANCE SHEET AS AT MARCH 31, 2024</h2>\n<h3>Note 3 : Property, Plant and Equipment and Right -of-Use Assets</h3>\n<h4>Accounting policy</h4>\n<p>Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses, if any. The cost comprises purchase price, including import duties and non- refundable purchase taxes, borrowing costs, if recognition criteria are met and any directly attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for the intended use. Any trade discounts and rebates are deducted in arriving at the purchase price.</p>\n<p>Subsequent expenditure related to an item of PPE is capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with these will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of the plant and equipment. When significant parts of plant and equipment are required to be replaced at intervals, the Company depreciates them separately based on their specific useful lives. Likewise, when a major inspection is performed, its cost is recognised in the carrying amount of the plant and equipment as a replacement if the recognition criteria are satisfied. All other repair and maintenance costs are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred.</p>\n<p>Items of stores and spares that meet the definition of PPE are capitalized at cost. Otherwise, such items are classified as inventories.</p>\n<p>Catalysts which are used in commissioning of new plant are capitalized and are amortized based on the estimated useful life as technically assessed. Subsequent issues of catalysts, if any, are treated as inventory.</p>\n<p>Gains or losses arising from derecognition of the assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognized.</p>\n<p>Depreciation on PPE is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate their cost, net of their residual values, over their useful lives estimated by the management based on technical evaluation, which are equal to the useful life prescribed under Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, other than the cases as mentioned in table below from S.No. (i) to (vi), where the useful lives are different from those prescribed in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013. The management believes that these estimated useful lives are realistic and reflect fair approximation of the period over which the assets are likely to be used. A major portion of the plant and equipment of the Company has been considered as continuous process plant.</p>\n<p>The estimated useful lives of assets are as follows:</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th><b>S .

Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if any. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic life. Software is the acquired intangible asset.<br>\nManagement of the Company assessed the useful life of software as finite and cost of software is amortized over its estimated useful life of five years on straight line basis.<br>\nThe amortization period and the amortization method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. If the expected useful life of the asset is significantly different from previous estimates, the amortization period is changed accordingly. If there has been a significant change in the expected pattern of economic benefits from the asset, the amortization method is changed to reflect the changed pattern. Such changes are accounted for in accordance with Ind AS-8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors”.<br>\nGains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognized.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:right;\">(Rs. in Crore)</p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width:100%; text-align:center;\">\n  <thead style=\"background:#d3d3d3;\">\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"width:45%; text-align:left;\">Particulars</th>\n      <th style=\"width:25%;\">Software</th>\n      <th style=\"width:25%;\">Total</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>Gross Book Value</b></td>\n      <td></td>\n      <td></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\">As at April 01, 2022</td>\n      <td>9.40</td>\n      <td>9.40</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\">Additions</td>\n      <td>0.54</td>\n      <td>0.54</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\">Deletions</td>\n      <td>(0.28)</td>\n      <td>(0.28)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>As at March 31, 2023</b></td>\n      <td><b>9.66</b></td>\n      <td><b>9.66</b></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\">Additions</td>\n      <td>2.46</td>\n      <td>2.46</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\">Deletions</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>As at March 31, 2024</b></td>\n      <td>12.12</td>\n      <td>12.12</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>Amortization</b></td>\n      <td></td>\n      <td></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\">As at April 01, 2022</td>\n      <td>7.46</td>\n      <td>7.46</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\">Charge for the year</td>\n      <td>1.10</td>\n      <td>1.10</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\">Deletions</td>\n      <td>(0.28)</td>\n      <td>(0.28)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>As at March 31, 2023</b></td>\n      <td><b>8.28</b></td>\n      <td><b>8.28</b></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\">Charge for the year</td>\n      <td>0.69</td>\n      <td>0.69</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\">Deletion</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>As at March 31, 2024</b></td>\n      <td>8.97</td>\n      <td>8.97</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>Net Book Value</b></td>\n      <td></td>\n      <td></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>As at March 31, 2023</b></td>\n      <td>1.38</td>\n      <td>1.38</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align:left;\"><b>As at March 31, 2024</b></td>\n      <td>3.15</td>\n      <td>3.15</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><b>Note 4B : Intangible Assets Under Development</b><br>\nIntangible assets under development of Rs. 0.32 Crore represents Digital Intervention Mobile Application (Previous Year : Rs. 0.99 Crore represents Ariba implementation and SAP upgradation).</p>\n<hr>",

  "<h2>Note 12 : Long Term Provisions</h2>\n<h3>Provision for Employee Benefits</h3>\n<h4>Accounting Policy</h4>\n<p>A provision is recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

The Company has generally concluded that it is the principal in its revenue arrangements because it typically controls the goods or services before transferring them to the customer. In determining the transaction price for the sale of goods, the Company considers the effects of variable consideration, the existence of significant financing components, noncash consideration, and consideration payable to the customer (if any).<br>\n<b>Sale of Goods</b><br>\nRevenue, including subsidy, in respect of sale of goods is recognised at a point in time when control of the goods has transferred, being when the goods are delivered to the buyer, the buyer has full discretion over the goods and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could affect the buyer’s acceptance of the goods. Revenue (other than subsidy) from the sales is recognised based on price specified in the contract, net of estimated volume discount. Amounts disclosed as revenue are net of returns and allowances, trade discounts, rebates and goods & services tax (GST). The Company collects GST on behalf of the government and therefore, these are not economic benefits flowing to the Company. Hence, these are excluded from the revenue.<br>\nThe Company does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer of the promised goods or services to the customer and payment by the customer exceeds one year.

Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise Information technology / Computer equipment and small items of office furniture.</p>\n<p>This note provides information for the leases where the Company is a lessee. The Company leases various offices and lease periods are generally fixed ranging from eleven months to nine years, but may have extension options.</p>\n<p><b>Amounts recognised in the Standalone Statement of Profit and Loss relating to Leases</b></p>\n<p><i>(Rs. in Crore)</i></p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Particulars</th>\n      <th>For the Year Ended<br>March 31, 2024</th>\n      <th>For the Year Ended<br>March 31, 2023</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Depreciation charge for Right-of-Use Assets</td>\n      <td>5.04</td>\n      <td>5.17</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Interest Expense (included in Finance Costs)</td>\n      <td>0.88</td>\n      <td>0.97</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Expense relating to short term leases (included in Other Expenses)</td>\n      <td>8.76</td>\n      <td>7.88</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Expense relating to leases of low - value assets that are not shown above as short term leases (included in Other Expenses)</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Expense relating to variable lease payments not included in Lease Liabilities</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><b>Amount recognised in the Standalone Statement of Cash Flows</b></p>\n<p><i>(Rs. in Crore)</i></p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Particulars</th>\n      <th>For the Year Ended<br>March 31, 2024</th>\n      <th>For the Year Ended<br>March 31, 2023</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Total cash outflow for Leases</td>\n      <td>5.68</td>\n      <td>5.88</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>",

The Board of Directors at its meeting held on May 08, 2010 had approved grant of financial assistance upto Rs. 30.00 Crore by the Company to Trust in such manner and on such terms as agreed between the trustee(s) of the Trust and Managing Director of the Company for the purpose of subscribing or acquiring shares of the Company.

Current income-tax expense or credit is measured at the amount expected to be paid to the taxation authorities in accordance with the Income-tax Act, 1961 enacted in India. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount of current income tax are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date. Deferred Income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax assets are realised, or the deferred income tax liabilities are settled.<br>\nCurrent income tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in OCI or in equity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.<br>\nDeferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date.<br>\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>When the deferred tax liability arises from an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and</li>\n  <li>In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interest in joint venture, when the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.</li>\n</ul>",
  "<h2>Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unused tax credits and any unused tax losses. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised.<br>\nThe carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-assessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.<br>\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.<br>\nDeferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss (either in OCI or in equity). Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in OCI or directly in equity.<br>\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are off-set if a legally enforceable right exists to set-off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.<br>\nMinimum Alternate Tax (MAT) paid in a year is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss as current tax. The Company recognizes MAT credit available as an asset only to the extent that there is convincing evidence that the Company will pay normal income tax during the specified period, i.e., the period for which MAT credit is allowed to be carried forward. In the year in which the Company recognizes MAT credit as an asset in accordance with the accounting framework and other applicable accounting pronouncements, the said asset is created by way of credit to the Statement of Profit and Loss and shown as “MAT Credit Entitlement” and grouped under Deferred Tax.

The derivatives are entered into with the banks / counterparties with investment grade credit ratings.</li>\n  <li>Long term Security Deposits / Employee loans - The fair value of security deposits / employee loans approximates the carrying value and hence, the valuation technique and inputs have not been given.</li>\n  <li>Floating Rate Borrowings / Lease Liabilities - The fair values of the Company’s interest bearing borrowings are determined by using discounted cash flow method using discount rate that reflects the issuer’s borrowing rate as at the end of the reporting period. The own non-performance risk as at March 31, 2024 was assessed to be insignificant.</li>\n  <li>The carrying amount of bank deposits, trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, investment at amortised cost, other current financial assets, trade payables, fixed rate borrowings and other current financial liabilities are considered to be the same as their fair values, due to their short term nature.</li>\n  <li>The fair value of investments carried at fair value through profit and loss is determined using Income Approach, Market Approach and Net Assets Value Method. Determining whether the investments in subsidiaries are impaired requires an estimate of the value in use of investments. In considering the value in use, the management anticipates the future growth rates, discount rates and other factors of the underlying businesses.</li>\n</ol>",
  "<h2>Fair Value Measurements</h2>\n<h3>Accounting Policy</h3>\n<h3>Derivative Financial Instruments</h3>\n<h4>Initial Recognition and Subsequent Measurement</h4>\n<p>Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date of derivative contract and are subsequently re-measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gains / losses are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of recognition in profit or loss / inclusion in the initial cost of non-financial asset depends on the nature of the hedging relationship and the nature of the hedged item. The Company complies with the principles of hedge accounting where derivative contracts are designated as hedge instruments. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Company documents the economic relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item including whether the changes in the cash flows of the hedging instrument are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items, along with the risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking hedge transaction.</p>\n<p>The Company has designated certain derivatives as hedge of foreign exchange risk associated with the cash flows of highly probable forecast transactions with borrowings.</p>\n<h3>Financial Instruments</h3>\n<p>A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li><b>Financial assets</b></li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Initial Recognition and Measurement</h4>\n<p>All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are expensed in profit or loss. Purchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e., the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.</p>\n<h4>Subsequent Measurement</h4>\n<h5>Debt Instruments</h5>\n<p>Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company’s business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset. For the purposes of subsequent measurement, debt instruments are classified in the following three categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Debt instruments at amortised cost.</li>\n<li>Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI); and</li>\n<li>Debt instruments at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Debt Instruments at amortised cost</h5>\n<p>A debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows; and</li>\n<li>Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the profit or loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the profit or loss.</p>\n<h5>Debt Instruments at FVTOCI</h5>\n<p>A debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n<li>The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and</li>\n<li>The asset’s contractual cash flows represent SPPI.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the OCI. However, the Company recognizes interest income, impairment losses &amp; reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to the Statement of Profit and Loss. Interest earned while holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.</p>",
  "<h2>Debt Instruments at FVTPL</h2>\n<p>FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorisation as at amortised cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL. In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’). Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.</p>\n<h3>Equity Instruments</h3>\n<p>For the purposes of subsequent measurement, equity instruments are classified in two categories: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Equity instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL); and</li>\n<li>Equity instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All equity investments are measured at fair value. The Company may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value in OCI. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. Equity instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.</p>\n<p>If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument as at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, on derecognition, including sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity.</p>\n<h3>Investment in Subsidiaries and Joint Venture</h3>\n<p>Investment in subsidiaries and joint venture is carried at deemed cost in the separate financial statements, except in case of investment in preference shares (debt instrument) of a subsidiary company which is carried in accordance with Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’.</p>\n<h3>Derecognition</h3>\n<p>A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or</li>\n<li>The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (i) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (ii) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Impairment of Financial Assets</h3>\n<p>The Company assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt instruments. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition. Assessment of such credit risk is being made on case-to-case basis based on available information.</p>\n<p>For trade receivables only, the Company applies the simplified approach permitted by Ind AS 109 ‘Financial Instruments’, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.</p>\n<p>The allowance for doubtful debts/ advances or impairment of assets is made on case-to-case basis by considering relevant available information.</p>\n<p><b>(b) Financial Liabilities</b></p>\n<h3>Initial recognition and measurement</h3>\n<p>Financial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, as loans and borrowings, as payables, or as derivatives. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Company’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including derivative financial instruments.</p>\n<h3>Subsequent Measurement</h3>\n<p>The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described below:</p>\n<h3>Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss</h3>\n<p>Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL) include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at FVTPL. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109 ‘Financial instruments. Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the profit or loss.</p>",
  "<h3>Loans and Borrowings</h3>\n<p>Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption / repayment amount is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that some or all the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all the facility will be drawn down, the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.</p>\n<p><b>Derecognition</b><br/>\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another financial liability on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.</p>\n<p><b>Offsetting of Financial Instruments</b><br/>\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are offset, and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.</p>\n<p><b>(i) Financial Instruments by Category</b></p>\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"4\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th rowspan=\"2\">Particulars</th>\n      <th colspan=\"3\">As at March 31, 2024</th>\n      <th colspan=\"3\">As at March 31, 2023</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>FVTPL</th>\n      <th>FVTOCI</th>\n      <th>Amortised Cost</th>\n      <th>FVTPL</th>\n      <th>FVTOCI</th>\n      <th>Amortised Cost</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr><td colspan=\"7\"><b>Financial Assets</b></td></tr>\n    <tr><td>Investments:</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> - Preference Shares</td>\n      <td>13.44</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>13.44</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> - Equity Shares</td>\n      <td>0.02</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>0.02</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> - Mutual Funds</td>\n      <td>1,932.19</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>1,837.30</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td> - Government Securities</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>0.00</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>0.00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Loan to Employees</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>0.13</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>0.21</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Security Deposits</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>4.47</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>4.62</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Trade Receivables</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>191.56</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>1,760.48</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Cash and Cash Equivalents</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>100.79</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>27.74</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Bank Balances other than Cash and cash equivalents</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>19.28</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>18.90</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Other Current Financial Assets</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>110.88</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>112.61</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Total Financial Assets</b></td>\n      <td><b>1,945.65</b></td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td><b>427.11</b></td>\n      <td><b>1,850.76</b></td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td><b>1,924.56</b></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr><td colspan=\"7\"><b>Financial Liabilities</b></td></tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Borrowings - Floating Rate</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>1,773.21</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>2,608.48</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Borrowings - Fixed Rate</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>647.64</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Lease Liabilities</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>20.38</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>23.13</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Trade Payables</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>793.47</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>1,210.95</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Derivative Financial Liabilities</td>\n      <td>0.43</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>9.43</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Other Current Financial Liabilities</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>405.84</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td>320.75</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td><b>Total Financial Liabilities</b></td>\n      <td><b>0.43</b></td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td><b>2,992.90</b></td>\n      <td><b>9.43</b></td>\n      <td>-</td>\n      <td><b>4,810.95</b></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p><b>(ii) Fair Value Hierarchy</b></p>\n<p><b>Accounting Policy</b></p>\n<p>The Company measures financial instruments, such as, derivatives at fair value at each reporting date</p>\n<p>Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.

For this analysis, the management verifies the major inputs applied in the latest valuation by comparing the information in the valuation computation to contracts and other relevant documents.<br>\nThe management, in conjunction with the Company’s external valuers and / or with available information, also compares the change in the fair value of each asset and liability with relevant available external sources to determine whether the change is reasonable.<br>\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities on the basis of the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above.<br>\nThis note summarises accounting policy for fair value.

The prices of Natural Gas are mostly linked to international crude oil prices which varies with the fluctuation in the prices of crude oil, demand supply pattern etc. The part of the natural gas quantity required by the Company has also been purchased at fixed price. The cost of natural gas is considered appropriately in line with the subsidy policies of Government of India for manufacture of Urea. As per the guidelines for pooling of gas in fertilizer (Urea) sector issued by the Government of India, the natural gas is available to the Urea manufacturer at uniform price. The Company did not enter into any transaction for hedging the fluctuations in the prices of natural gas.</li>\n  <li>The Company deals in imported fertilisers (i.e. DAP, MOP and NPK), which are imported by the Company and sold in the domestic market. The prices of imported fertilisers may fluctuate due to demand-supply scenario, outage of plants, fluctuation in prices of raw materials etc.<br>\n      The Company takes following steps to mitigate the risk pertaining to fluctuation in prices:\n      <ul>\n        <li>Dynamic sourcing strategy and review of demand and supply on regular basis;</li>\n        <li>No long term commitments; and</li>\n        <li>Constant review of market condition including costing of competitors.</li>\n      </ul>\n      The Company did not enter into any transactions to hedge the risk pertaining to fluctuation in prices.\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>(ii) Credit Risk</b></p>\n<p>Credit risk is the risk that counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) including deposits with banks and financial institutions, foreign exchange transactions and other financial instruments.</p>\n<p><b>a) Trade Receivables</b></p>\n<p>The Company’s receivables can be classified into two categories, one is from the customers/ dealers in the market and second one is from the Government of India in the form of subsidy. As far as Government portion of receivables are concerned, credit risk is low. In respect of market receivables from the customers/ dealers, the Company extends credit to customers in normal course of business. The Company considers factors such as credit track record in the market and past dealings for extension of credit to customers. The Company monitors the payment track record of the customers and outstanding customer receivables are regularly monitored. The Company evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables as low, as its customers are located in several states and operate in largely independent markets.

Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities affected in future periods.</p>\n\n<p><b>a) Property, Plant and Equipment</b><br>\nProperty, Plant and Equipment represent a significant proportion of the asset base of the Company. The charge in respect of periodic depreciation is derived after determining an estimate of an asset’s expected useful life and the expected residual value at the end of its life. The useful lives and residual values of Company’s assets are determined by the management at the time the asset is acquired and reviewed periodically, including at each financial year end. The lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as anticipation of future events, which may impact their life, such as changes in technical or commercial obsolescence arising from changes or improvements in production or from a change in market demand of the product or service output of the asset.</p>\n\n<p><b>b) Income Taxes</b><br>\nDeferred Tax Assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable profits together with future tax planning strategies.<br>\nThe Company has Rs. 15.54 Crore (Previous Year: Rs. 104.56 Crore) of carried forward tax losses on account of long term/ short term capital losses. These losses mainly relate to the loss on voluntary liquidation of a subsidiary of the Company and merger of a subsidiary of the Company with its subsidiary and will expire in one to four years and may be used to offset taxable long term / short term capital gains in the future. On this basis, the Company has determined that it cannot recognise deferred tax assets on these tax losses (long term/ short term capital losses) carried forward. If the Company would have been able to recognise all unrecognised deferred tax assets, profit and equity would have increased by Rs. 5.28 Crore (Previous Year: Rs.36.49 Crore). Further details on taxes are disclosed in note 36 to the financial statements.<br>\nThe Government of India has introduced the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Act, 2019 and has given the option of lower tax rate subject to certain conditions. As the Company has Minimum Alternate Tax (“MAT”) credit mainly due to addition of New Urea</p>",
  "<section>\n  <p>\n    Plant in the past and it is expected that the Company will utilise entire MAT credit next year, the management has carried out an assessment according to which the Company shall continue under the existing tax regime and move to lower tax rate after next financial year. In view of above, the Company had re-assessed the deferred tax liability as per Ind AS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ and resultant impact if any has been recognised . Accordingly, the ‘Deferred Tax’ for the financial year ended March 31, 2024 includes a credit of Nil (Previous Year: Rs. 83.90 Crore).\n  </p>\n  <p><b>c) Defined Benefit Plans</b></p>\n  <p>\n    The cost of the defined benefit gratuity plan, post-employment medical benefits and other defined benefit plans and the present value of the obligation of defined benefit plans are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The parameter most subject to change is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate for defined benefit plans, the management considers the interest rates of government bonds.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables. Those mortality tables tend to change only at interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases are based on the expected future inflation rates. Further details about the defined benefit plans are given in note 30 to the financial statements.\n  </p>\n  <p><b>d) Revenue</b></p>\n  <p>\n    The Company’s revenue includes subsidy claims, part of which are pending notification / final implementation by ‘Fertiliser Industry Coordination Committee’ (FICC), Government of India. As per management estimates, there is reasonable certainty based on Government of India policy and past experience that claims will be notified in due course. On issuance of notification by FICC, Government of India, the adjustments, if any, to revenue are not expected to be significant.\n  </p>\n  <p><b>e) Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments</b></p>\n  <p>\n    When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including discounted cash flow method. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets wherever possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. The judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of financial instruments. Further disclosures in this regard are given in note 38.\n  </p>\n</section>\n\n<section>\n  <table>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>\n          <p><b>For Price Waterhouse Chartered Accountants LLP<br> Firm Registration No. 012754N/ N500016</b></p>\n          <p><b>Abhishek Rara</b><br> Partner <br> Membership No. : 077779</p>\n          <p><b>Place : New Delhi<br> Date : May 07, 2024</b></p>\n        </td>\n        <td>\n          <p><b>For and on behalf of the Board of Directors of<br> Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals Limited</b></p>\n          <p><b>Rita Menon</b><br> Director <br> DIN: 00064714</p>\n          <p><b>Abhay Baijal</b><br> Managing Director <br> DIN: 01588087</p>\n          <p><b>Anand Agarwal</b><br> Chief Financial Officer</p>\n          <p><b>Tridib Barat</b><br> Company Secretary</p>\n          <p><b>Place : New Delhi<br> Date : May 07, 2024</b></p>\n        </td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</section>"

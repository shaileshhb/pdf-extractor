    </p>

    <h3>B BASIS OF PREPARATION</h3>

    <p>
      The standalone financial statements have been prepared and presented under the historical cost convention and
      accrual basis of accounting, unless otherwise stated and are in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting
      Principles in India (‘Indian GAAP’), statutory requirements prescribed under the Third Schedule of the Banking
      Regulation Act, 1949, directions, circulars, notifications and guidelines issued by the Reserve Bank of India
      (‘RBI’) from time to time (RBI guidelines), Accounting Standards (‘AS’) specified under Section 133 of the
      Companies Act, 2013 read together with the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 and the Companies (Accounting
      Standards) Rules, 2021, in so far as they apply to banks.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Use of estimates</b><br />
      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with Indian GAAP requires the management to make estimates
      and necessary assumptions in the reported amounts of assets and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) as
      at the date of the financial statements and the reported income and expenses for the reporting year. Management
      believes that the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual
      results could differ from these estimates. The impact of any revision in the accounting estimates is recognised
      prospectively from the period of change.
    </p>

    <h3>C SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</h3>

    <h4>1. Investments</h4>

    <p>
      The RBI, vide its master direction dated September 12, 2023, issued revised norms for the classification,
      valuation and operation of investment portfolio of banks, which became applicable from April 01, 2024 (herein
      after referred as ‘revised norms on investments’).
    </p>

    <p><b>Classification:</b></p>

    <p>
      In accordance with the revised norms on investments, investments are classified on the date of purchase into “Held
      to Maturity” (‘HTM’), “Available for Sale” (‘AFS’) and “Fair value through Profit and Loss” (‘FVTPL’) categories
      (hereinafter called “categories”). “Held for Trading” (‘HFT’) is a separate investment sub-category within FVTPL.
      All investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are categorised in a distinct category Group
      companies (“Group cos”). Under each of these categories, investments are further classified under six groups
      (hereinafter called “groups”) - Government Securities, Other Approved Securities, Shares, Debentures and Bonds,
      Investments in Subsidiaries / Joint Ventures and Other Investments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hitherto, investments were classified on the date of purchase into “Held for Trading” (‘HFT’), “Available for
      Sale” (‘AFS’) and “Held to Maturity” (‘HTM’) categories. (hereinafter called “categories”). Subsequent shifting
      amongst the categories was done in accordance with the RBI guidelines. Under each of these categories, investments
      were further classified into six groups (hereinafter called “groups”), Government securities, Other approved
      securities, Shares, Debentures and Bonds, Investments in subsidiaries / Joint Ventures and Other Investments.
    </p>

    <p>
      Purchase and sale transactions in securities are accounted on settlement date except in the case of equity shares
      which are accounted on trade date.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3><b>Basis of classification:</b></h3>
    <p>
      Investments which the Bank intends to hold till maturity and contractual terms there of gives rise to cash flows
      that are solely payment of principal and interest on principal outstanding (SPPI) are classified under HTM
      category. All investments in subsidiaries / associates / joint ventures are classified under the category of Group
      Companies (Group Cos.). Investments which the Bank acquires with an objective that is achieved by both collecting
      contractual cashflows and selling securities and where the contractual terms of the investment meet the SPPI
      criterion are classified under AFS category. Investments not classified in any of the above categories are
      classified under FVTPL category. HFT, which is a sub-category of FVTPL consists of all instruments that meet the
      specifications for HFT instruments prescribed by the RBI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitherto, investments which the Bank intended to hold till maturity were classified under HTM category and
      investments that were held for resale within 90 days from the date of purchase were classified under HFT.
      Investments which were not classified in either of the above categories were classified under AFS category.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Acquisition cost:</b></h3>
    <p>
      Costs, including brokerage and commission paid at the time of acquisition of investments and broken period
      interest on debt instruments, are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and are not included in the cost of
      acquisition.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Valuation:</b></h3>
    <p>In accordance with the revised norms on investments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Investments classified under FVTPL and AFS categories are fair valued individually. Net gain or loss arising on
        such valuation of FVTPL category is directly taken to the Profit and Loss Account. The net appreciation or
        depreciation (adjusted for the effect of applicable taxes, if any) in AFS Category is directly taken to AFS
        reserve without routing through the Profit &amp; Loss Account.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Hitherto, investments classified under AFS and HFT categories were marked to market individually, and depreciation
      / appreciation was aggregated for each group. Net depreciation, if any, compared to the acquisition cost, in any
      of the six groups, was charged to the Profit and Loss Account and net appreciation, if any, in any of the six
      groups was not recognised except to the extent of depreciation provided earlier.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Quoted investments are valued based on the trades / quotes on the recognised stock exchanges or prices published
        by Financial Benchmarks India Pvt Ltd. (FBIL) or Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association (FIMMDA).
        Investments denominated in foreign currencies are valued based on the prices provided by market information
        providers such as Bloomberg, Refinitiv, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unquoted Government of India securities, state government securities and special bonds such as oil bonds,
        fertilizer bonds etc. issued by the Government of India are valued as per the prices published by FBIL. The
        valuation of other unquoted fixed income securities (viz. other approved securities and bonds and debentures)
        and preference shares is done with appropriate mark-up, i.e. applicable FIMMDA published credit spreads over the
        Yield to Maturity (YTM) rates for Government of India securities as published by FBIL.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unquoted equity shares are valued at the break-up value, ascertained from the company’s latest balance sheet.
        The date as on which the latest balance sheet is drawn up does not precede the date of valuation by more than 18
        months. In case the latest audited balance sheet is not available or is more than 18 months old, the shares are
        valued at ₹ 1 per company.
      </li>
      <li>Units of mutual funds are valued at the latest Net Asset Value (NAV) declared by the mutual fund.</li>
      <li>
        Treasury bills, commercial papers and certificate of deposits being discounted instruments are valued at

        as per the net asset value provided by the issuing Asset Reconstruction Company and InvIT respectively.
      </li>
      <li>

    <p>
      its investments by an independent valuer as per the frequency mandated by SEBI, the value of its units is treated
      as ₹ 1. In case AIF is not registered under SEBI (Alternative Investment Fund) Regulation, 2012, and the latest
      disclosed valuation of its investments by an independent valuer precedes the date of valuation by more than 18
      months the value of its units is treated as ₹ 1.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Pass Through Certificates (PTCs) including Priority Sector-PTCs are valued by using FIMMDA credit spreads as
        applicable for the NBFC category, based on the credit rating of the respective PTC over the YTM rates for
        Government of India securities published by FBIL.
      </li>

      <li>
        Investments classified under HTM and Group Cos. category are carried at their acquisition cost and not marked to
        market. Any diminution, other than temporary, in the value of investments in HTM and Group Cos. category is
        provided for. Hitherto, any premium on investments classified under HTM category, was amortised over the
        remaining maturity period of the security on a constant yield-to-maturity basis.
      </li>

      <li>
        For all debt securities meeting SPPI criteria (except short sale securities), any discount or premium on
        acquisition is accreted or amortised over the remaining maturity period of the security on a constant
        yield-to-maturity basis. Such accretion or amortisation of discount or premium is classified under interest
        income from investments.
      </li>

      <li>
        The investment portfolio is categorised into three fair value hierarchies viz. Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Level 1 Financial Instruments are valued with inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical
            instruments.
          </li>
          <li>
            Level 2 Financial Instruments are valued with inputs other than quoted prices, that are observable for asset
            or liability either directly or indirectly.
          </li>
          <li>Level 3 Financial Instruments are valued using unobservable inputs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>
        All investments are measured at fair value on initial recognition. Unless facts and circumstances suggest that
        the fair value is materially different from the acquisition cost, it is presumed that the acquisition cost is
        the fair value. In case of Level 1 and Level 2 instruments, when acquisition cost is not equal to fair value,
        any Day 1 gain / loss is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. In case of Level 3 instruments, any Day 1
        loss is recognized immediately in the Profit and Loss Account whereas any Day 1 gain is deferred. In case of
        Level 3 debt instruments, the Day 1 gain is amortized on a straight-line basis up to the maturity date (or
        earliest call date for perpetual instruments), while for unquoted Level 3 equity instruments, the gain is set
        aside as a liability until the security is listed or derecognised.
      </li>

      <li>
        Non-performing investments (NPIs) are identified, and provision is made thereon based on the RBI guidelines.
        Provision for NPIs is not set-off against appreciation in respect of performing investments. Appreciation, if
        any, in the value of a NPI is not recognised. Income on NPIs is not recognised until received.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><b>Disposal of investments:</b></h3>
    <p>
      In accordance with the revised norms on investments, Profit / Loss on sale of investments under the aforesaid
      categories is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account except for equity instruments designated under AFS at the
      time of initial recognition, in respect of which the gains and losses are transferred from AFS Reserve to the
      Capital Reserve. Hitherto entire Profit / Loss on sale of investments, were recognised in the Profit and Loss
      Account. Cost of investments is determined based on the weighted average cost method. The profit from sale of
      investment under HTM and Group Cos. categories, net-off taxes and transfer to statutory reserve is appropriated
      from the Profit and Loss Account to “Capital Reserve”, in accordance with RBI guidelines.
    </p>

    <h3><b>Short sale:</b></h3>
    <p>
      The Bank undertakes short sale transactions in Central Government dated securities in accordance with the RBI
      guidelines. The short position is categorised under HFT and netted off from investments in government securities.
      The short position along with other government securities under HFT portfolio is marked to market and the
      resultant MTM profit or loss, is taken to the Profit and Loss Account. Profit / Loss on short sale is recognised
      on settlement date.

      Repurchase (Repo) and reverse repurchase (Reverse Repo) transactions are reported as borrowing and lending
      (lending above 14 days tenor reported as advances) respectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Borrowing cost on repo transactions is accounted as interest expense and revenue on reverse repo transactions is
      accounted as interest income.
    </p>
    <h2>3. Advances</h2>
    <h3><b>Classification:</b></h3>
    <p>
      Advances are classified as performing and non-performing based on the RBI guidelines and are stated net of bills
      rediscounted, inter-bank participation with risk, specific loan loss provision, interest suspense for
      non-performing advances, claims received from Credit Guarantors, provision for funded interest term loan and
      provision for diminution in the fair value of restructured assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bank classifies its loans and investments, including overseas branches and overdues from crystallised
      derivative contracts, into performing assets and non-performing assets (NPAs) in accordance with RBI guidelines.
      Further the NPAs are classified into sub-standard, doubtful and loss assets based on the criteria stipulated by
      RBI. Non-performing assets are upgraded into standard as per the extant RBI guidelines.
    </p>
    <h3><b>Provisioning:</b></h3>
    <p>
      Specific loan loss provision in respect of non-performing advances is made based on management’s assessment of the
      degree of impairment of advances, subject to the minimum provisioning prescribed by the RBI.
    </p>
    <p>
      The specific loan loss provision for retail non-performing advances is also made based on the nature of product
      and delinquency levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Non-performing advances are written-off in accordance with the Bank’s policy. Recoveries from bad debts
      written-off are included under other income.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loans reported as frauds are classified as loss assets and fully provided for immediately without considering the
      value of security.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bank maintains general provision for standard assets including credit exposures computed as per the current
      marked to market values of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and gold. The Bank also
      maintains general provision for unhedged foreign currency exposures of borrowers, provision on loans to specific
      borrowers in specific stressed sectors, provision on exposures to step-down subsidiaries of Indian companies and
      provision on specified borrowers as prescribed by RBI. In the case of overseas branches, general provision on
      standard assets is maintained at the higher of the levels stipulated by the respective overseas regulator or RBI.
      The provision for standard assets is included under other liabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the above, the Bank on a prudent basis makes provision on advances or exposures which are not NPAs,
      but has reasons to believe on the basis of the extant environment or specific information or basis regulatory
      guidance / instructions, of a possible slippage of a specific advance or a group of advances or exposures or
      potential exposures. These are classified as contingent provisions and included under other liabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Provision made in addition to the Bank’s policy for specific loan loss provision for non-performing assets,
      possible slippage of specific exposures and regulatory general provision is categorised as floating provision.
      Creation of floating provision is considered by the Bank up to a level approved by the Board of Directors.
      Floating provisions are used only for contingencies under extraordinary circumstances and for making specific
      provisions for non-performing accounts. Floating provisions are included under other liabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Further to the provisions required to be held according to the asset classification status, provision is held for
      individual country exposures (other than for home country exposure). Countries are categorised into risk
      categories as per Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. (‘ECGC’) guidelines and provisioning is made
      in respect of that country where the net funded exposure is one percent or more of the Bank’s total assets.
      Provision for country risk is included under other liabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In accordance with the RBI guidelines on the prudential framework for resolution of stressed assets and the
      resolution frameworks for COVID-19 related stress and its Board approved policy, the Bank has implemented
      resolution plans for eligible borrowers. The asset classification and necessary provision thereon is made

    <h2>SCHEDULES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
    <p><i>As at March 31, 2025</i></p>
    <p>
      in accordance with the said RBI guidelines. Restructured assets involving compromise settlements, where the time
      for payment of the agreed settlement amount exceeds three months are classified and provided for in accordance
      with the guidelines issued by the RBI from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The restructured loans are upgraded into standard category as per the extant RBI guidelines. Further, in respect
      of restructuring of loans pertaining to projects under implementation, the asset classification and necessary
      provision thereon is made in accordance with the said RBI guidelines.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Securitisation and transfer of assets</h3>
    <p>
      Assets transferred through securitisation and direct assignment of cash flows are de-recognised in the Balance
      Sheet when they are sold (true sale criteria being fully met with) and consideration is received. Sales /
      transfers that do not meet true sale criteria are accounted for as borrowings. For a securitisation or direct
      assignment transaction, the Bank recognises profit upon receipt of the funds and loss is recognised at the time of
      sale. Unrealised gains associated with expected future margin income is recognised in profit and loss account on
      receipt, after absorbing losses, if any.
    </p>
    <p>
      On sale of stressed assets, if the sale is at a price below the net book value (i.e., funded outstanding less
      specific provisions held), the shortfall is charged to the Profit and Loss Account and if the sale is for a value
      higher than the net book value, the excess provision is credited to the Profit and Loss Account in the year when
      the sum of cash received by way of initial consideration and / or redemption or transfer of security receipts
      issued by Securitisation Company (‘SC’) / Reconstruction Company (‘RC’) exceeds the net book value of the loan at
      the time of transfer. Where the sale consideration is comprised of only cash and SRs guaranteed by the Government
      of India, the excess provision is credited to the Profit and Loss Account in the year of transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In respect of stressed assets sold under an asset securitisation, where the investment by the bank in SRs issued
      against the assets transferred by it is more than 10 percent of such SRs, provisions held against outstanding SRs
      are higher of the provisions required in terms of net asset value declared by the SC / RC and provisions as per
      the extant norms applicable to the underlying loans, notionally treating the book value of these SRs as the
      corresponding stressed loans assuming the loans remained in the books of the Bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bank invests in PTCs issued by Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs). These are accounted at acquisition cost and
      are classified as investments. The Bank also buys loans through the direct assignment route which are classified
      as advances. PTCs are carried at acquisition cost unless it is more than the face value, in which case the premium
      is amortised based on effective interest rate method.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bank transfers advances through inter-bank participation with and without risk. In the case of participation
      with risk, the aggregate amount of the participation issued by the Bank is reduced from advances. In case where
      the Bank is assuming risk by participation, the aggregate amount of the participation is classified under
      advances. In the case of issue of participation certificate without risk, the aggregate amount of participation
      issued by the Bank is classified under borrowings and where the Bank is acquiring participation certificate, the
      aggregate amount of participation acquired is shown as due from banks under advances.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Fixed assets and depreciation</h3>
    <p>
      Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation as adjusted for impairment, if any. Cost includes
      cost of purchase and all expenditure like site preparation, installation costs and professional fees incurred on
      the asset before it is ready to use. Subsequent expenditure incurred on assets put to use is capitalised only when
      it increases the future benefit / functioning capability from / of such assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depreciation is charged over the estimated useful life of the fixed asset on a straight-line basis except for
      freehold land. The management believes that the useful life of assets assessed by the Bank, pursuant to Part C of
      Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, taking into account changes in environment, changes in technology, the
      utility and efficacy of the asset in use, fairly reflects its estimate of useful lives of the fixed assets. The
      estimated useful lives of key fixed assets are given below:

    <h3>6. Non-Banking Assets</h3>
    <p>
      Non-Banking Assets (NBAs) acquired in satisfaction of claims are carried at lower of net book value or net
      realizable value.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Impairment of assets</h3>
    <p>
      The Bank assesses at each Balance Sheet date whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired.
      Impairment loss, if any, is provided to the extent the carrying amount of assets exceeds their estimated
      recoverable amount.
    </p>

    <h3>8. Translation of foreign currency items</h3>
    <p>
      Foreign currency income and expenditure items of domestic operations are translated at the exchange rates
      prevailing on the date of the transaction. Income and expenditure items of integral foreign operations
      (representative offices) are translated at the weekly average closing rates and of non-integral foreign operations
      (foreign branches and offshore banking units) at the monthly average closing rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outstanding foreign currency monetary items of domestic and integral foreign operations are translated at the
      closing exchange rates notified by Foreign Exchange Dealers’ Association of India (FEDAI) as at the Balance Sheet
      date and the resulting net revaluation profit or loss is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both monetary and non-monetary foreign currency assets and liabilities of non-integral foreign operations are
      translated at closing exchange rates notified by FEDAI at the Balance Sheet date and the resulting profit / loss
      arising from exchange differences are accumulated in the Foreign Currency Translation Reserve until disposal of
      the non-integral foreign operations in accordance with AS - 11, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates
      and the extant RBI guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foreign currency denominated contingent liabilities on account of foreign exchange and derivative contracts,
      guarantees, letters of credit, acceptances and endorsements are translated at closing rates of exchange notified
      by FEDAI as at the Balance Sheet date.
    </p>

    <h3>9. Foreign exchange and derivative contracts</h3>
    <p>
      Foreign exchange spot and forward contracts, outstanding as at the Balance Sheet date and held for trading, are
      revalued at the closing spot and forward rates respectively as notified by FEDAI and at interpolated rates for
      contracts of interim maturities. The USD-INR exchange rate for valuation of contracts having longer maturities
      i.e. greater than one year, is derived using the USD-INR spot rate as well as relevant INR yield curve and USD
      yield curve. For other currency pairs, and non-deliverable contracts, the forward points (for rates / tenors not
      published by FEDAI) are obtained / derived basis data published by Refinitiv or Bloomberg for valuation of

    <p>
      the contracts. Valuation is considered on present value basis. For this purpose, the forward profit or loss on the
      contracts are discounted to the valuation date using the discounting yields. The resulting profit or loss on
      valuation is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. Marked to market value of foreign exchange contracts are
      classified as assets when the fair value is positive or as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Bank recognises all derivative contracts at fair value, on the date on which such derivative contracts are
      entered into and are re-measured at fair value as at the Balance Sheet date. Marked to market values of such
      derivatives are classified as assets when the fair value is positive or as liabilities when the fair value is
      negative.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Bank as part of its risk management strategy, makes use of derivative instruments, including foreign exchange
      forward contracts, for hedging the risk embedded in some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the
      balance sheet. The Bank identifies the hedged item (asset or liability) at the inception of the transaction
      itself. Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of the inception of the hedge and at the reporting date
      thereafter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Foreign exchange forward contracts and Principal only swaps (POS) not intended for trading, that are entered into
      to establish the amount of reporting currency required or available at the settlement date of a transaction, and
      are outstanding at the Balance Sheet date, are accounted in accordance with AS-11. Accordingly, such contracts are
      not marked to market and only translated at spot rate. The premium or discount arising at the inception of such
      forward exchange contract is amortised on a straight line basis as expense or income over the life of the
      contract. The interest income / expense on such POS transaction is accounted on accrual basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      In case of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items are
      recognised in the Profit and Loss Account and in case of cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of effective
      portion are recognised in Reserves and Surplus under ‘Cash flow hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an
      effective hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. The accumulated balance in
      the cash flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging relationship, is recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at
      the same time that the impact from the hedged item is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
    </p>

    <p>
      In relation to derivative contracts with non-performing borrowers, the Bank makes provision for the entire amount
      of overdue and future receivables relating to positive marked to market value of the said derivative contracts.
    </p>

    <h3>10. Revenue recognition</h3>

    <p>
      Interest income is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account on an accrual basis, except in the case of
      non-performing assets which is recognised when realised.
    </p>

    <p>
      Interest income on investments in PTCs and loans bought out through the direct assignment route is recognised at
      their effective interest rate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Income on non-coupon bearing discounted instruments is recognised over the tenor of the instrument on a constant
      yield basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dividend on equity shares and preference shares is recognised as income when the right to receive the dividend is
      established.
    </p>

    <p>Income from units of mutual funds / AIF is recognised on cash basis.</p>

    <p>
      Loan processing fee is recognised as income when due. Syndication / Arranger fee is recognised as income when a
      significant act / milestone is completed.
    </p>

    <p>Gain / loss on sell down of loans is recognised in line with the extant RBI guidelines.</p>

    <p>
      Guarantee commission, commission on letter of credit, annual locker rent fees and annual fees for credit cards are
      recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of contract. Other fees and commission income are recognised
      when due, where the Bank is reasonably certain of ultimate collection.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fees paid / received for priority sector lending certificates (PSLC) is recognised on straight-line basis over the
      period of the certificate.
    </p>

    <h3>11. Employee benefits</h3>

    <p><b>Stock based Employee Compensation:</b></p>

    <p>
      The Employee Stock Option Scheme (‘the Scheme’) provides for the grant of options to acquire equity shares of the
      Bank to its employees and whole time directors.<br />
      The Employee Stock Incentive Master Scheme-2022
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      (ESIS-2022) provides for the grant of Restricted Stock Units (units) to acquire equity shares of the Bank to its
      employees and whole time directors. The options / units granted shall vest as per their vesting schedule and these
      may be exercised within a specified period.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bank followed the intrinsic value method to account for its stock-based employee compensation plans in respect
      of options granted up to March 31, 2021. Compensation cost was measured by the excess, if any, of the market price
      of the underlying stock over the exercise price as determined under the option plan. The market price is the
      closing price on the stock exchange where there is highest trading volume on the working day immediately preceding
      the date of grant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effective April 01, 2021, the fair value of share-linked instruments on the date of grant for all instruments
      granted after March 31, 2021 is recognised as an expense in accordance with the RBI guidelines on Compensation of
      Whole Time Directors / Chief Executive Officers / Material Risk Takers and Control Function staff.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair value of the stock-based employee compensation is estimated on the date of grant using Black-Scholes
      model.
    </p>
    <p>
      The compensation cost is amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period after adjusting estimated
      forfeiture. Ultimately, the cost for all instruments that vest is recognised. The compensation expense is
      recognised in the Profit and Loss Account with a corresponding credit to Employee Stock Options Outstanding. On
      exercise of the stock options, corresponding balance in Employee Stock Options Outstanding is transferred to Share
      Premium. In respect of the options which expire unexercised, the balance standing to the credit of Employee Stock
      Options Outstanding is transferred to General Reserve.
    </p>
    <p><b>Gratuity:</b></p>
    <p>
      The Bank has an obligation towards gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan covering all eligible employees.
      The plan benefit vests upon completion of minimum prescribed period of continuous years of service and is in the
      form of lump sum amount, without an upper limit, equivalent to 15 days’ basic salary payable for each completed
      year of service to all eligible employees on resignation, retirement or death while in employment or on
      termination of employment, except in respect of employees of eHDFC Limited, where the vesting is equivalent to one
      month’s basic salary for each completed year of service till the effective date of amalgamation. The Bank makes
      contributions to a recognised Gratuity Trust administered by trustees and whose funds are managed by insurance
      companies. In respect of erstwhile Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) employees, the Bank makes contribution to a fund set
      up by eLKB and administered by the Board of Trustees. The defined gratuity benefit plans are valued by an
      independent actuary as at the Balance Sheet date using the projected unit credit method as per the requirement of
      AS-15, Employee Benefits, to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation and the related service
      costs. The actuarial calculations entails assumptions about demographics, early retirement, salary increases and
      interest rates. Actuarial gain or loss is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><u>Superannuation:</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bank has a Superannuation Plan under which employees of the Bank, above a prescribed grade, are entitled to
      receive retirement benefits either through salary or under a defined contribution plan. For those opting for a
      defined contribution plan, the Bank contributes a sum equivalent to 13% of the employee’s eligible annual basic
      salary (15% for the whole time directors and for certain eligible employees of the erstwhile Centurion Bank of
      Punjab (eCBoP staff)) to a Trust administered by trustees and whose funds are managed by insurance companies. The
      Bank has no liability towards future superannuation fund benefits other than its contribution and recognises such
      contribution as an expense in the year incurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b><u>Provident fund:</u></b>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bank is covered under the Employees Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and accordingly all
      employees of the Bank are entitled to receive benefits under the provident fund. The Bank contributes an amount,
      on a monthly basis, at a determined rate (currently 12% of employee’s basic salary). Of this, the Bank contributes
      an amount equal to 8.33% of employee’s basic salary up to a maximum salary level of ₹ 15,000/- per month, to the
      Pension Scheme administered by the Regional Provident Fund Office. The balance amount out of the 12% employer’s
      share is contributed to an exempted Trust set up by the Bank and administered by the Board of Trustees. The Bank
      recognises such contributions as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.

      Interest payable to the members of the exempted trust shall not be lower than the statutory rate of interest
      declared by the Central Government under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 and
      shortfall, if any, shall be made good by the Bank.
    </p>

    <p>
      The guidance note on implementing AS-15, Employee Benefits, states that benefits involving employer established
      provident funds, which require interest shortfalls to be provided, are to be considered as defined benefit plan.
      Actuarial valuation of this Provident Fund interest shortfall is done as per the guidance note issued in this
      respect by The Institute of Actuaries of India (IAI) and provision towards this liability is made.
    </p>

    <p>
      The overseas branches of the Bank make contribution to the respective applicable government social security scheme
      calculated as a percentage of the employees’ salaries. The Bank’s obligations are limited to these contributions,
      which are expensed when due, as such contribution is in the nature of defined contribution.
    </p>

    <p><b>Pension:</b></p>
    <p>
      In respect of pension payable to certain eLKB employees under the Lord Krishna Bank (Employees) Pension Scheme,
      which is a defined benefit scheme, the Bank contributes 10% of basic salary to a pension trust set up by the Bank
      and administered by the Board of Trustees and an additional amount towards the liability shortfall based on an
      independent actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet date, which includes assumptions about demographics, early
      retirement, salary increases and interest rates.
    </p>

    <p>
      In respect of certain eLKB employees who had moved to a Cost to Company (CTC) based compensation structure and had
      completed less than 15 years of service, the contribution which was made until then, is maintained as a fund and
      will be converted into annuity on separation after a lock-in-period of two years. For this category of employees,
      liability stands frozen and no additional provision is required except for interest as applicable to Provident
      Fund, which is provided for.
    </p>

    <p>
      In respect of certain eLKB employees who moved to a CTC structure and had completed service of more than 15 years,
      pension would be paid on separation based on salary applicable as on the date of movement to CTC structure.
      Provision thereto is made based on an independent actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet date.

      In respect of employees who opt for contribution to the NPS, the Bank contributes certain percentage of the basic
      salary of employees to the aforesaid scheme, a defined contribution plan, which is managed and administered by
      pension fund management companies. The Bank has no liability other than its contribution and recognises such
      contributions as an expense in the year incurred.
    </p>

    <p><b>12. Debit and credit cards reward points</b></p>
    <p>
      The Bank estimates the probable redemption of debit and credit card reward points and cost per point using an
      actuarial method by employing an independent actuary, which includes assumptions such as discount rate, block,
      withdrawal, cost per reward point, mortality, redemption and spends. Provisions for liabilities on the outstanding
      reward points are made based on an independent actuarial valuation as at the Balance Sheet date and included in
      other liabilities and provisions.
    </p>

    <p><b>13. Bullion</b></p>
    <p>
      The Bank imports bullion including precious metal bars on a consignment basis or through exchange (India
      International Bullion Exchange – Gift City). The imports are typically on a back-to-back basis and are priced to
      the customer based on the price quoted by the supplier. The difference between the price recovered from customers
      and cost of bullion is accounted at the time of sale to the customers and reported as “Other Income”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bank also deals in bullion on a borrowing and lending basis and the interest thereon is accounted as interest
      expense / income respectively.
    </p>

    <p><b>14. Segment information</b></p>
    <p>
      The disclosure relating to segment information is in accordance with AS-17, Segment Reporting and as per
      guidelines issued by RBI.
    </p>

    <p><b>15. Lease accounting</b></p>
    <p>
      Lease payments including cost escalation for assets taken on operating lease are recognised as expense in the
      Profit and Loss Account over the lease term on a straight-line basis in accordance with the AS-19, Leases.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2>16. Earnings per share</h2>
    <p>
      The Bank reports basic and diluted earnings per equity share in accordance with AS-20, Earnings per Share. Basic
      earnings per equity share has been computed by dividing net profit for the year attributable to equity
      shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding for the year. Diluted earnings per share
      reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue equity shares were
      exercised or converted to equity during the year. Diluted earnings per equity share are computed using the
      weighted average number of equity shares and the dilutive potential equity shares outstanding during the year
      except where the results are anti-dilutive.
    </p>

    <h2>17. Income tax</h2>
    <p>
      Income tax expense is the aggregate amount of current tax and deferred tax expense incurred by the Bank. Current
      tax expense is determined in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and rules framed
      thereunder and considering the material principles set out in the Income Computation and Disclosure Standards to
      the extent applicable. Deferred tax expense is determined as per AS-22, Accounting for Taxes on Income. Deferred
      tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the future tax consequences of timing differences between the
      carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and operating loss carried forward, if
      any. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted or substantively enacted tax rates as at
      the Balance Sheet date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Current tax assets and liabilities and deferred tax assets and liabilities are off-set when they relate to income
      taxes levied by the same taxation authority, when the Bank has a legal right to off-set and when the Bank intends
      to settle on a net basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent there is reasonable certainty that the assets can be
      realised in future. In case of unabsorbed depreciation or carried forward loss under taxation laws, deferred tax
      assets are recognised only if there is virtual certainty of realisation of such assets. Deferred tax assets are
      reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and appropriately adjusted to reflect the amount that is reasonably /
      virtually certain to be realised.
    </p>

    <h2>18. Accounting for provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets</h2>
    <p>
      In accordance with AS-29, “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”, the Bank recognises
      provisions when it has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of
      resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and when a reliable estimate of
      the amount of the obligation can be made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Provisions are determined based on management estimate required to settle the obligation at the Balance Sheet
      date, supplemented by experience of similar transactions. These are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and
      adjusted to reflect the current management estimates.
    </p>
    <p>A disclosure of contingent liability is made when there is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        a possible obligation arising from a past event, the existence of which will be confirmed by the occurrence or
        non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not within the control of the Bank; or
      </li>
      <li>
        a present obligation arising from a past event which is not recognised as it is not probable that an outflow of
        resources will be required to settle the obligation or a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation
        cannot be made.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When there is a possible obligation or a present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of
      resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contingent assets, if any, are not recognised in the financial statements since this may result in the recognition
      of income that may never be realised.
    </p>

    <h2>19. Cash and cash equivalents</h2>
    <p>
      Cash and cash equivalents include cash, gold in hand, rupee digital currency with RBI, balances with RBI, balances
      with other banks and money at call and short notice.
    </p>

    <h2>20. Share issue expenses</h2>
    <p>
      Share issue expenses are adjusted against Share Premium Account in terms of Section 52 of the Companies Act, 2013.
    </p>

    <h2>21. Corporate social responsibility</h2>

    <h3>1. <b>Amalgamation of HDFC Limited</b></h3>
    <p>
      The Board of Directors at its meeting held on April 04, 2022, approved a composite Scheme of amalgamation
      (“Scheme”), for the amalgamation of: (i) erstwhile HDFC Investments Limited (“eHDFC Investments”) and erstwhile
      HDFC Holdings Limited (“eHDFC Holdings”), with and into erstwhile Housing Development Finance Corporation Limited
      (“eHDFC Limited”); and thereafter (ii) eHDFC Limited into HDFC Bank Limited (“Bank”), and their respective
      shareholders and creditors, under Sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, 2013 and other applicable laws
      including the rules and regulations. The Scheme was approved by the shareholders at the National Company Law
      Tribunal (“NCLT”) convened meeting of the shareholders of the Bank held on November 25, 2022. The NCLT, in
      accordance with Sections 230 to 232 of the Companies Act, 2013 and rules thereunder, vide its order dated March
      17, 2023 sanctioned the Scheme. Upon receipt of all requisite approvals, the Bank filed form INC 28 with Registrar
      of Companies on July 01, 2023 and accordingly, the Scheme became effective on July 01, 2023. As per the Scheme,
      the appointed date for the amalgamation of eHDFC Limited with and into the Bank is the same as effective date of
      the Scheme i.e. July 01, 2023. The Profit and Loss Account for the year ended March 31, 2025 include the
      operations of eHDFC Limited which amalgamated with and into HDFC Bank on July 01, 2023 and hence are not
      comparable with the Profit and Loss Account for the year ended March 31, 2024.
    </p>

    <p>
      The amalgamation was accounted under the ‘pooling of interest’ method as prescribed in Accounting Standard-14
      “Accounting for amalgamation” (“AS-14”). Outstanding balances between eHDFC Limited and the Bank were eliminated
      as on July 01, 2023. All assets and liabilities of eHDFC Limited were recognised by the Bank at their carrying
      amounts as on that date except for adjustments to bring about uniformity of accounting policies as required under
      AS-14. The share capital of ₹ 311.04 crore issued by the Bank as consideration pursuant to the Scheme was adjusted
      against the corresponding share capital of eHDFC Limited of ₹ 370.29 crore and the difference was adjusted to
      Amalgamation Reserve. Further, excess of cost over face value of Investment in shares of the Bank by eHDFC Limited
      of ₹ 14,006.31 crore was adjusted to Amalgamation Reserve. Consequently, the Bank recognised a debit balance of ₹
      13,947.06 crore in the Amalgamation Reserve as a result of these adjustments.

      Summarized values of assets and liabilities taken over as at July 01, 2023 in accordance with the terms of the
      Scheme is as detailed below:

      authorised capital of eHDFC Limited with the authorised share capital of the Bank. In terms of the Scheme, the
      Bank issued and allotted 3,11,03,96,492 equity shares to the shareholders of eHDFC Limited as on July 13, 2023,
      being the record date fixed by the Board of Directors as per the Scheme, in accordance with the share exchange
      ratio i.e. 42 equity shares of face value of ₹ 1/- each of the Bank for every 25 equity shares of face value of ₹
      2/- each of eHDFC Limited. Accordingly, the paid-up share capital of the Bank increased from ₹ 559.18 crore
      consisting of 5,59,17,98,806 equity shares of ₹ 1/- each to ₹ 753.76 crore consisting of 7,53,75,69,464 equity

    <h3><b>2.</b> Proposed dividend</h3>
    <p>
      The Board of Directors at its meeting held on April 19, 2025 proposed a dividend of ₹ 22.00 per equity share
      (previous year: ₹ 19.50 per equity share) aggregating to ₹ 16,834.89 crore subject to the approval of shareholders
      at the ensuing Annual General Meeting. During the year ended March 31, 2025, the dividend paid by the Bank in
      respect of the previous year ended March 31, 2024 was ₹ 14,826.19 crore. In terms of the AS-4 “Contingencies and
      events occurring after the balance sheet date”, the Bank has not appropriated the proposed dividend from the
      Profit and Loss Account and the same will be recognised in the year of actual payout post approval. However,
      effect of the proposed dividend has been reckoned in determining capital funds in computation of the capital
      adequacy ratio.
    </p>

    <h3><b>3.</b> Change in accounting policy</h3>
    <p>
      The RBI, vide its master direction dated September 12, 2023, issued revised norms (herein after referred as
      ‘revised norms on investments’) for the classification, valuation and operation of investment portfolio of banks,
      which became applicable from April 01, 2024. While hitherto, the investment portfolio was classified under the
      Held to Maturity (HTM), Available for Sale (AFS) and Held for Trading (HFT) categories, the revised norms bring in
      a principle-based classification of investment portfolio and a symmetric treatment of fair value gains and losses.
      In accordance with the revised norms and the Bank’s board approved policy, the Bank has classified its investment
      portfolio as on April 01, 2024 under the categories of Held to Maturity (HTM), Available for Sale (AFS),
      subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures and Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL) with Held for Trading
      (HFT) as a sub-category of FVTPL, and from that date, measures and values the investment portfolio under the
      revised framework. On transition to the framework on April 01, 2024, the Bank has recognised a net gain of ₹
      482.87 crore (net of tax of ₹ 127.00 crore) which has been credited to general reserve, in accordance with the
      said norms. The impact of the revised framework subsequent to the transition is not ascertainable and as such the
      income / profit or loss from investments for the year ended March 31, 2025, is not comparable with that of the
      previous year.
    </p>

    <h3><b>4.</b> Capital adequacy</h3>
    <p>
      The Bank’s capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (‘Capital Adequacy Ratio’) is calculated in accordance with the
      RBI guidelines on Basel III capital regulations (‘Basel III’). The minimum capital ratio requirement under Basel
      III as at March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024 is as follows:

    <p><b>Accounting for employee share based payments</b></p>

    <p>
      The shareholders of the Bank approved the grant of equity stock options under Plan “C” in June 2005, Plan “D” in
      June 2007, Plan “E” in June 2010, Plan “F” in June 2013, Plan “G” in July 2016 and Plan “H” in August 2024. The
      Bank also approved the Employee Stock Incentive Master Scheme in May 2022. Under the terms of each of these plans,
      the Bank may issue to its employees and Whole Time Directors, Equity Stock Options (‘ESOPs’) or Restricted Stock
      Units (‘Units’) each of which is convertible into one equity share. Further, pursuant to the amalgamation of eHDFC
      Limited with and into Bank effective from July 01, 2023, the existing ESOP Schemes of the eHDFC Limited comprising
      of eHDFC 2007, eHDFC 2008, eHDFC 2014, eHDFC 2017 and eHDFC 2020 were taken over by the Bank.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the plans were framed in accordance with the SEBI (Employee Stock Option Scheme &amp; Employee Stock Purchase
      Scheme) Guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and as applicable at the time of the grant. The accounting
      for the stock options has been in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Share Based Employee
      Benefits and Sweat Equity) Regulations, 2021 and RBI guidelines to the extent applicable.
    </p>

    <p>
      The plans provide for the issuance of options at the recommendation of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee
      of the Board (‘NRC’) at the closing price on the working day immediately preceding the date when options are
      granted. This closing price is the closing price of the Bank’s equity share on an Indian stock exchange with the
      highest trading volume as of the working day preceding the date of grant. Further, the units are issued at the
      face value of the equity share of ₹ 1/-

    <h2>Qualitative disclosure on LCR</h2>
    <p>
      The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) is one of the Basel Committee’s key reforms to develop a more resilient banking
      sector. The objective of the LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks.
      It does this by ensuring that banks have an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) that
      can be converted easily and immediately into cash to meet their liquidity needs for a 30 calendar day liquidity
      stress scenario. The LCR is expected to improve the banking sector’s ability to absorb shocks arising from
      financial and economic stress, whatever the source, thus reducing the risk of spillovers from the financial sector
      to the real economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Liquidity Risk Management of the Bank is governed by the Asset Liability Management (ALM) Policy approved by
      the Board. The Asset Liability Committee (ALCO) is a decision-making unit responsible for implementing the
      liquidity and interest rate risk management strategy of the Bank in line with its risk management objectives and
      ensures adherence to the risk tolerance / limits set by the Board. The Bank has also set up a senior level
      management committee, viz., the Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC) under the ICAAP framework of the Bank, to
      establish a formal and dedicated structure to periodically assess the nature / quantum of material risks of the
      subsidiaries and adequacy of its risk management processes, including providing oversight for managing liquidity
      risk. Liquidity for the Bank’s domestic banking operations is directly managed at the Head Office. The overseas
      branches and offshore unit of the Bank independently manage their liquidity requirements with support from the
      Head Office. Similarly, the Bank’s subsidiaries independently manage their liquidity requirements under guidance
      of the GRMC, which, along with senior management of the subsidiaries, reviews the risk assessment of material
      risks at the subsidiaries. Further, the Bank maintains suitable systems and processes to monitor liquidity
      requirements in other currencies as appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to determine cash outflows, the Bank segregates its deposits into various customer segments, viz., Retail
      (which include deposits from individuals), Small Business Customers (those with deposits upto ₹ 7.5 crore), and
      Wholesale (which would cover all residual deposits). Other contractual funding, including a portion of other
      liabilities which are expected to run down in a 30-day time frame are included in the cash outflows. These
      classifications, based on extant regulatory guidelines, are part of the Bank’s LCR framework, and are also
      submitted to the RBI.
    </p>
    <p>
      The LCR is calculated by dividing a Bank’s stock of HQLA by its total net cash outflows over a 30-day stress
      period. The present minimum requirement, as on March 31, 2025, is 100%.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Indian context, the run-off factors for the stressed scenarios are prescribed by the RBI, for various
      categories of liabilities (viz., deposits, unsecured and secured wholesale borrowings), undrawn commitments,
      derivative-related exposures, and offset with inflows emanating from assets maturing within the same time period.
      Given below is a table of run-off factors and the average LCR maintained by the Bank quarter-wise over the past
      two years:

    <h2><b>Divergence in the asset classification and provisioning</b></h2>
    <p>
      In terms of the RBI guidelines, banks are required to disclose the divergence in asset classification and
      provisioning consequent to RBI’s annual supervisory process in their notes to accounts to the financial

      <li><b>Unhedged foreign currency exposure</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Bank has in place a policy and process for managing currency induced credit risk. The credit appraisal
      memorandum prepared at the time of origination and review of a credit facility is required to discuss the exchange
      risk that the customer is exposed to from all sources, including trade related, foreign currency borrowings and
      external commercial borrowings. It could cover the natural hedge available to the customer as well as other
      hedging methods adopted by the customer to mitigate exchange risk. For foreign currency loans granted by the Bank
      beyond a defined threshold the customer is encouraged to enter into appropriate risk hedging mechanisms with the
      Bank. Alternatively, the Bank satisfies itself that the customer has the financial capacity to bear the exchange
      risk in the normal course of its business and / or has other mitigants to reduce the risk. On a periodic basis,
      the Bank reviews information on the unhedged portion of foreign currency exposures of customers, whose total
      foreign currency exposure with the Bank exceeds a defined threshold. A Board approved credit risk rating linked
      limit on unhedged foreign currency position of customers is applicable when extending credit facilities to a
      customer. The compliance with the limit is assessed by estimating the extent of drop in a customer’s annual
      Earnings Before Interest and Depreciation (‘EBID’) due to a potentially large adverse movement in exchange rate
      impacting the unhedged foreign currency exposure of the customer. Where a breach is observed in such a simulation,
      the customer is suitably advised to review and manage its unhedged exposure, where deemed necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bank holds standard asset provisions of ₹ 318.05 crore (previous year: ₹ 392.13 crore) and maintains capital
      (including D-SIB) of ₹ 1,551.56 crore (previous year: ₹ 1,692.53 crore) as at March 31, 2025, in respect of the
      unhedged foreign currency exposure of its customers.

    <p><b>• Qualitative disclosures on risk exposure in derivatives</b></p>

    <p><i>Overview of business and processes</i></p>

    <p>
      Derivatives are financial instruments whose characteristics are derived from underlying assets, or from interest
      rates, exchange rates or indices. These include forwards, swaps, futures and options. The notional amounts of
      financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and derivatives provide a basis for comparison with the
      instruments recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows
      involved or the current fair value of the instruments and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to
      credit or price risks. The following sections outline the nature and terms of the derivative transactions
      generally undertaken by the Bank.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><i>Interest rate contracts</i></p>

    <p>
      <b>Forward rate agreements</b> give the buyer the ability to determine the underlying rate of interest for a
      specified period commencing on a specified future date (the settlement date). The underlying rate of interest
      could be an interest rate curve, interest rate index or bond yield. There is no exchange of principal and
      settlement is effected on the settlement date. The settlement amount is the difference between the contracted rate
      and the market rate prevailing on the settlement date discounted for the interest period of the agreement.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Interest rate swaps</b> involve the exchange of interest obligations with the counterparty for a specified
      period without exchanging the underlying (or notional) principal.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Interest rate caps and floors</b> give the buyer the ability to fix the maximum or minimum rate of interest.
      The writer of the contract pays the amount by which the market rate exceeds or is less than the cap rate or the
      floor rate respectively. A combination of interest rate caps and floors can create structures such as interest
      rate collar, cap spreads and floor spreads.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Interest rate futures</b> are standardised interest rate derivative contracts traded on a recognised stock
      exchange to buy or sell a notional security or any other interest bearing instrument or an index of such
      instruments or interest rates at a specified future date, at a price determined at the time of the contract.
    </p>

    <p><i>Exchange rate contracts</i></p>

    <p>
      <b>Forward foreign exchange</b> contracts are agreements to buy or sell fixed amounts of currency at an agreed
      exchange rate on a future date. These instruments are carried at fair value, determined based on either FEDAI
      rates or market quotations.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Cross currency swaps</b> are agreements to exchange principal amounts denominated in different currencies.
      Cross currency swaps may also involve the exchange of interest payments on one specified currency for interest
      payments in another specified currency for a specified period.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Currency options (including Exchange Traded Currency Option)</b> give the buyer, on payment of a premium, the
      right but not an obligation, to buy or sell specified amounts of currency at an agreed exchange rate on or before
      a specified future date.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Currency futures</b> contract is a standardised contract traded on an exchange, to buy or sell a certain
      underlying currency on a certain date in the future, at a specified price. The contract specifies the rate of
      exchange between one unit of currency with another.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Bank’s derivative transactions relate to sales and trading activities. Sale activities include the structuring
      and marketing of derivatives to customers to enable them to hedge their market risks (both interest rate and
      exchange risks), within the regulatory framework as applicable from time to time. The Bank deals in derivatives on
      its own account (trading activity) principally for the purpose of generating a profit from short term fluctuations
      in price yields or implied volatility. The Bank also deals in derivatives to hedge the risk embedded in some of
      its Balance Sheet assets or liabilities.
    </p>

    <p><b>Constituents involved in derivative business</b></p>

    <p>
      The Treasury front-office enters into derivative transactions with customers and inter-bank counterparties. The
      Bank has an independent back-office and mid-office as per regulatory guidelines. The Bank has credit risk and
      market risk departments, as part of the Risk Management Group, that assesses counterparty credit risk and market
      risk limits, within the risk architecture and processes of the Bank.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2><b>SCHEDULES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</b></h2>
    <p><i>For the year ended March 31, 2025</i></p>

    <h3><b>Derivative policy</b></h3>
    <p>
      The Bank has in place a Derivative policy which covers various aspects that apply to the functioning of the
      derivative business. The derivative business is administered through various market risk limits such as position
      limits, tenor limits, sensitivity limits, scenario based profit and loss limit for option portfolio, stop loss
      trigger levels and value-at-risk limits that are recommended by the Risk Policy and Monitoring Committee (‘RPMC’)
      to the Board of Directors for approval. All methodologies that are used to assess market and credit risks for
      derivative transactions are specified by the market risk and credit risk units. Limits are monitored on a daily
      basis by the mid-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bank has a Board approved policy on Customer Suitability &amp; Appropriateness, which forms part of the
      Derivative policy, to ensure that derivative transactions entered into are appropriate and suitable to the
      customer’s nature of business / operations. Before entering into a derivative deal with a customer, the Bank
      scores the customer on various risk parameters and based on the overall score level it determines the kind of
      product that best suits its risk appetite and the customer’s requirements.
    </p>

    <h3><b>Classification of derivatives book</b></h3>
    <p>
      The derivative book is classified into trading and hedging book. Classification of the derivative book is made on
      the basis of the definitions of the trading and hedging specified in the RBI guidelines. The trading book is
      managed within the trading limits recommended by the RPMC and approved by the Board of Directors.
    </p>

    <h3><b>Hedging policy</b></h3>
    <p>
      For derivative contracts designated as hedging instruments, the Bank documents, at inception of the hedge, the
      relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the risk management objective for undertaking the
      hedge and the methods used to assess the hedge effectiveness. Hedge effectiveness is ascertained at the time of
      inception of the hedge and periodically thereafter. Hedge effectiveness is measured by the degree to which changes
      in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item that are attributable to a hedged risk are offset by changes in
      the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument using various qualitative and quantitative methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hedging book consists of transactions to hedge Balance Sheet assets or liabilities. The tenor of hedging
      instrument may be less than or equal to the tenor of underlying hedged asset or liability. The Bank as part of its
      risk management strategy, makes use of derivative instruments, including foreign exchange forward contracts, for
      hedging the risk embedded in some of its financial assets or liabilities recognised on the Balance Sheet. In case
      of a fair value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items are recognised in
      the Profit and Loss Account and in case of cash flow hedges other than for foreign exchange forward contracts and
      principal only swaps, the changes in fair value of effective portion are recognised in Reserves and Surplus under
      ‘Cash flow hedge reserve’ and ineffective portion of an effective hedging relationship, if any, is recognised in
      the Profit and Loss Account. The accumulated balance in the cash flow hedge reserve, in an effective hedging
      relationship, is recycled in the Profit and Loss Account at the same time that the impact from the hedged item is
      recognised in the Profit and Loss Account. Foreign exchange forward contracts and principal only swaps not
      intended for trading, that are entered into to establish the amount of reporting currency required or available at
      the settlement date of a transaction, and are outstanding at the Balance Sheet date, are accounted in accordance
      with AS-11. Accordingly, such contracts are not marked to market and only translated at spot rate. The premia or

      The Bank enters into derivative transactions with counterparties based on their business ranking and financial
      position. The Bank sets up appropriate appetite / limits upon evaluating the ability of the counterparty to honour
      its obligations in the event of crystallisation of the exposure. Appropriate credit covenants are stipulated where
      required, as trigger events to

      call for collaterals or terminate a transaction and contain the risk. Further, to mitigate the current exposure in
      non-centrally cleared forex and derivative transactions, Bank has entered into Credit Support Annex (‘CSA’)
      agreements with some of the major international counterparty banks and few Indian financial institutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Bank, at the minimum, conforms to the RBI guidelines with regard to provisioning requirements. Overdue
      receivables representing crystallised positive mark to market value of a derivative contract are transferred to
      the account of the borrower and treated as non-performing assets, if these remain unpaid for 90 days or more. Full
      provision is made for the entire amount of overdue and future receivables relating to positive marked to market
      value of non-performing derivative contracts.

        The Bank has computed the maximum and minimum of PV01 for the year based on the balances as at the end of every

      </li>
      <li>
        In respect of derivative contracts, the Bank has computed the exposure under the Current Exposure Method for

        Qualified Financial Contracts – Amendments to Prudential Guidelines” dated March 30, 2021 and any related
        amendments thereafter. However, for the purpose of calculating product-wise derivative exposure as mentioned in
        point number 3 in table above, Bank has calculated using Current Exposure Method (‘CEM’) without the impact of
        Bilateral Netting.

      accordance with regulatory requirements and provides a framework to create, modify and maintain appropriate
      compensation programs and processes with adequate supervision and control.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bank’s performance management system provides a sound basis for assessing employee performance holistically.
      The Bank’s compensation framework is aligned with the performance management system and differentiates pay
      appropriately amongst its employees based on degree of contribution, performance, skill, experience, grade and
      availability of talent owing to competitive market forces. Further, the Bank also considers compliance to
      processes, regulatory compliance and risk management as an integral part of its performance appraisal process.
      These factors are given due weightage for the purposes of the final performance rating of employees for a given
      performance year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NRC considers the aforementioned principles enunciated in the Bank’s compensation policy and ensures that:
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>the compensation is adjusted for all types of prudent risk taking;</li>
      <li>compensation outcomes are symmetric with risk outcomes;</li>
      <li>compensation payouts are sensitive to the time horizon of risk; and</li>
      <li>the mix of cash, equity and other forms of compensation are aligned with risk.</li>

    <h3><b>II. Design and Structure of Remuneration</b></h3>
    <p>
      The design and structure of remuneration in accordance with the RBI guidelines dated November 04, 2019, for the
      financial year ended March 31, 2025, is as follows:

    <p>For the year ended March 31, 2025</p>

    <section>
      <p><b>a) Fixed Pay</b></p>

      <p>
        The Remuneration Policy ensures that the fixed component of the compensation is reasonable, taking into account
        all relevant factors including industry practice.
      </p>

      <p><b>Elements of Fixed Pay:</b></p>

      <p>
        The fixed pay component of the Bank’s compensation structure typically consists of elements such as base salary,
        allowances, perquisites and retirement benefits. Perquisites extended are in the nature of company car, company
        leased accommodation, club membership and such other benefits or allowances in lieu of such perquisites /
        benefits. Retirement benefits include contributions to Provident Fund, Superannuation Fund (for employees above
        certain job bands), National Pension Scheme and Gratuity. The Bank also provides pension to certain employees of
        the erstwhile Lord Krishna Bank (eLKB) under the Indian Banks’ Association (‘IBA’) structure.
      </p>

      <p><b>Determinants of Fixed Pay:</b></p>

      <p>
        The fixed pay is primarily determined by taking into account factors such as the job size, performance,
        experience, location, market competitiveness of pay and is designed to meet the following key objectives of:
      </p>

      <ol type="a" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
        <li>fair compensation given the role complexity and size;</li>
        <li>fair compensation given the individual’s skill, competence, experience and market pay position;</li>
        <li>contribution to post retirement benefits; and</li>
        <li>compliance with all statutory obligations.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The quantum of fixed pay for the Senior Management i.e. Employees in Executive Vice President and above grades,
        Material Risk Takers other than Whole time Directors, Risk and Control Staff and Key Management Personnel are
        approved by the NRC and the Board.
      </p>

      <p>
        The quantum of fixed pay for Whole Time Directors is approved by the NRC and the Board, and is subject to the
        approval of the RBI.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p><b>b) Variable Pay – For Senior Management and Material Risk Takers</b></p>

      <p>
        The performance management system forms the basis for variable pay allocation of the Bank. The Remuneration
        Policy of the Bank ensures that the performance management system is comprehensive and considers both,
        quantitative and qualitative performance measures.
      </p>

      <p><b>(i) Composition of Variable pay</b></p>

      <p>
        The variable pay will be in the form of share linked instruments or a mix of cash and share linked instruments.
        The share linked instrument used in the financial year 2024-25 was the Employee Stock Options. All plans for
        grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time and are
        approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the grant of options post approval by the NRC.
        For Whole time Directors the variable pay is approved by the NRC, Board and the Reserve Bank of India.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Bank will ensure that there is a proper balance between Fixed Pay and Variable Pay. In cases where
        compensation by way of share-linked instruments is not permitted by law / regulations, the entire variable pay
        will be in cash.
      </p>
    </section>
    <hr />
    <h3><b>(ii)</b> Limits on Variable pay</h3>
    <p>
      A substantial portion of compensation i.e. at least 50% will be variable and paid on the basis of individual,
      business-unit and organization performance. This will be in line with the principle that, at higher levels of
      responsibility, the proportion of variable pay will be higher. The total variable pay shall be limited to a
      maximum of 300% of the fixed pay (for the relative performance period).
    </p>
    <p>
      In case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in case the
      variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay shall be via non-cash instruments. The non-cash
      component in 2024-25 comprised of Employee Stock Options.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share-linked instruments, his /
      her variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay.
    </p>

    <h3><b>(iii)</b> Deferral of Variable pay</h3>
    <p>
      For senior management including Whole time Directors (WTDs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), deferral arrangements
      exists for the variable pay. A minimum of 60% of total variable pay is under deferral arrangements. If cash
      component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus is deferred. In cases where cash component
      of the bonus is under Rs 25 lakh, deferral arrangements is not necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deferral period is a minimum of three years and is applicable to both cash and non-cash components of variable
      pay. The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs is governed by the ESOP Scheme Rules which is
      approved by the NRC and the Board. In 2024-25, the deferment of cash variable pay, where applicable, was 3 years
      in the case of cash variable pay and 4 years (vesting period) in the case of Employee Stock Options.
    </p>

    <h3><b>(iv)</b> Vesting of Variable pay</h3>
    <p>
      The deferred portion of the remuneration vests at the end of deferral period and is spread out over the course of
      the deferral period. The first vesting is not before one year from the commencement of the deferral period. The
      vesting is no faster than on a pro rata basis and the frequency of the vesting is more than a year in order to
      ensure appropriate assessment of risk.
    </p>

    <h3><b>(v)</b> Malus / Clawback Arrangement</h3>
    <p>
      The Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking. The Bank, therefore, has
      devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Malus Arrangement:</b> The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout for the
      deferred portion of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument). The
      RBI guidelines define malus thus “A <b>malus</b> arrangement permits the bank to prevent vesting of all or part of
      the amount of a deferred remuneration. Malus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has already occurred.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Clawback Arrangement:</b> The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward (cash
      variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument) made in the previous years attributable
      to a given reference year wherein the incident has occurred. The return would be in terms of net amount. The RBI
      guidelines define clawback thus “A <b>clawback</b> is a contractual agreement between the employee and the bank in
      which the employee agrees to return previously paid or vested remuneration to the bank under certain
      circumstances.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The malus and clawback clause will be actioned when the employee demonstrates behaviour involving fraudulent
      behaviour, moral turpitude, lack of integrity, flagrant breach of company policies and statutory norms resulting
      in

    <h2>SCHEDULES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
    <p><i>For the year ended March 31, 2025</i></p>
    <p>
      financial or non-financial losses. Manifestation of behaviour listed above is presumed to have a malafide intent.
      Illustrative list of conditions are enumerated below. The occurrence of any / some / all of the following
      conditions / events shall trigger a review by the NRC for the application of the Malus or the Clawback
      arrangement:
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Substantial Financial Deterioration in profitability or risk parameters</li>
      <li>Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior</li>
      <li>Fraud that requires a financial restatement</li>
      <li>Reputational harm</li>
      <li>Exposing the bank to substantial risk</li>
      <li>
        Such other conditions or events, of similar nature as above, as determined by NRC for triggering review by NRC
        for the purpose of application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      In determining the causes for deterioration in financial performance under (a), the NRC may take into
      consideration and have due regard to the fact whether the deterioration was for factors within control or whether
      it was on account of conditions like global market headwinds, industry performance, changes in legal / regulatory
      regime, force majeure events like occurrence of natural disasters, pandemic, other socio-economic conditions etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      While undertaking the review for the concerned person for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement
      based on any trigger events, when determining accountability of the concerned person, the NRC shall be guided by
      the principles of proportionality, culpability or proximity or nexus to the event or misconduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      In accordance with the RBI guidelines, wherever the assessed divergence in bank’s provisioning for Non-Performing
      Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public disclosure, the bank shall not
      pay the unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment year under ‘malus’ arrangement. Further,
      in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for the assessment year) shall be entertained. In
      case the bank’s post assessment Gross NPAs are less than 2.0%, these restrictions will apply only if criteria for
      public disclosure are triggered either on account of divergence in provisioning or both provisioning and asset
      classification.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NRC may decide to apply malus on part, or all of the variable pay. The time horizon for the application of
      malus / clawback clause shall be four years from the date of reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NRC shall review the act of misconduct / incident to ascertain the degree of accountability attributable to a
      Whole time Director / Material Risk Taker / Senior Management (Job Bands C 1 and above) prior to applying the
      Malus or Clawback arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>The criteria for Malus / Clawback will be reviewed by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee annually.</p>
    <p>
      The NRC and Board of Directors has also approved an addendum (Addendum-B) to the compensation policy on Clawback
      of Incentive Compensation in view of the final rules on listing standards for the recovery of erroneously awarded
      compensation adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 26, 2022, applicable to companies listed
      on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Addendum-B shall be read with, and is in addition to, the Compensation Policy formulated and approved by the
      Board of Directors of the Bank. The same has been formulated to comply with the requirements of Section 10D
      promulgated under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), and Section
    </p>

    <p>
      303A.14 of the NYSE so as to recover certain compensation in the event of an accounting restatement due to any
      material non-compliance relating to any financial reporting requirements under the applicable U.S. securities
      laws, and shall be interpreted and applied consistent therewith.
    </p>

    <p><b>(vi) Approval Process</b></p>

    <p>
      The Variable Pay for Senior Management, Material Risk Takers other than Whole time Directors, Risk and control
      staff is approved by the NRC and the Board. For Whole time Directors the variable pay is approved by the NRC,
      Board and the Reserve Bank of India.
    </p>

    <p><b>Employees other than Senior Management, Material Risk Takers, Whole Time Directors</b></p>

    <p>The Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans:</p>

    <p><b>(i) Annual Bonus Plan</b></p>

    <p>
      The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the business unit,
      performance of the individual employee, job band of the employee and the functional category. Basis these key
      determinants and due adjustment for risk alignment, a payout matrix for variable pay is developed. Market trends
      for specific businesses / functions along with inputs from compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the
      payout.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in both the
      quantum and the method of payout across functions.
    </p>

    <p><b>(ii) Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)</b></p>

    <p>
      PLPs are formulated for employees in sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given
      business / service targets but have limited impact on risk since credit decisions are exercised independent of
      these functions. All PLP payouts are based on a balanced scorecard framework which factors not just quantitative,
      but also qualitative measures, and are subject to achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective
      scorecards of the employees. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to
      provide for any unforeseen performance risks. Employees who are on the PLPs are excluded from the Annual Bonus
      Plan.
    </p>

    <p><b>(iii) Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOPs)</b></p>

    <p>
      Employees in Job Bands D4 and above also receive ESOPs as a vehicle to create a balance between short term rewards
      and long term sustainable value creation. ESOPs play a key role in the attraction and retention of key talent.
    </p>

    <p>
      The NRC grants options after considering parameters such as the incumbent’s grade and performance rating, and such
      other factors as may be deemed appropriate by the NRC.
    </p>

    <p>
      All plans for grant of options are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to
      time and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the grant of options post approval
      by the NRC.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Bank grants ESOPs to eligible employees. Such ESOPs vest over four tranches spread over a period of 48 months.
    </p>

    <p>In accordance with the RBI guidelines, Employee Stock Options is included as part of Variable Pay.</p>
    <hr />
    <h2><b>(iv) Restricted Stock Units (Units)</b></h2>
    <p>
      The Bank granted units to employees at E3 – D3 bands (upto 10 levels below the MD). The same was approved by the
      NRC after considering parameters such as the employee’s grade, performance rating and any other factors as may be
      deemed appropriate by the NRC.
    </p>
    <p>
      All plans for grant of units are framed in accordance with the SEBI guidelines, 1999 as amended from time to time
      and are approved by the shareholders of the Bank. These plans provide for the grant of units post approval by the
      NRC.
    </p>
    <p>Such units vest over four tranches spread over a period of 48 months.</p>
    <p><b>Risk, Control and Compliance Staff</b></p>
    <p>
      The Bank has separated the Risk, Control and Compliance functions from the Business functions in order to create a
      strong culture of checks and balances and to eliminate any possible conflict of interest between revenue
      generation and risk management and control. Accordingly, the overall variable pay as well as the annual salary
      increment of the employees in the Risk, Control and Compliance functions is based on their performance, functional
      objectives and goals. The Bank ensures that the mix of fixed to variable compensation for these functions is
      weighted in favour of fixed compensation.
    </p>
    <p><b>Guaranteed Bonus</b></p>
    <p>
      Guaranteed bonuses are not consistent with sound risk management or pay for performance principles of the Bank and
      therefore do not form an integral part of the general compensation practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      For critical hiring for some select strategic roles, the Bank may consider granting of bonus, based on the
      performance rating upon confirmation, as a prudent way to avoid loading the entire cost of attraction into the
      fixed component of the compensation which could have a long term cost implication for the Bank. For such hiring,
      the said bonus is generally decided by taking into account appropriate risk factors and market conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      For hiring at levels of Whole Time Directors / Managing Director / Material Risk Takers and certain employees in
      select strategic roles, a sign-on bonus, if any, is limited to the first year only and would be in the form of
      Employee Stock Options or Units (All units grants are subject to individual / Business Unit / organizational
      performance criteria).
    </p>
    <p><b>Severance Pay</b></p>
    <p>
      The Bank does not grant severance pay other than accrued benefits (such as gratuity, pension) except in cases
      where it is mandated by any statute.
    </p>
    <p><b>Hedging</b></p>
    <p>
      The Bank does not provide any facility or fund or permit its Whole Time Directors and employees to insure or hedge
      their compensation structure to offset the risk alignment effects embedded in their compensation arrangement.
    </p>
    <p><b>Statutory Bonus</b></p>
    <p>
      Some employees are also paid statutory bonus as per the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 as amended from time to time.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3>III. Remuneration Processes</h3>

    <h4>Fitment at the time of Hire</h4>

    <p>
      Pay scales at the Bank are set basis the job size, experience, location and the academic and professional
      credentials of the incumbent.
    </p>

    <p>
      The compensation of new hires is in line with the existing pay ranges and consistent with the compensation levels
      of the existing employees of the Bank at similar profiles. The pay ranges are subject to change basis market
      trends and the Bank’s talent management priorities. While the Bank believes in the internal equity and parity as a
      key determinant of pay, it does acknowledge the external competitive pressures of the talent market. Accordingly,
      there could be certain key profiles with critical competencies which may be hired at a premium and treated as an
      exception to the overall pay philosophy. Any deviation from the defined pay ranges is treated as a hiring
      exception requiring approval with appropriate justification.
    </p>

    <h4>Pay Increment / Pay Revision</h4>

    <p>
      The Bank strives to ensure external competitiveness as well as internal equity without diluting the overall focus
      on optimising cost. In order to enhance the Bank’s external competitiveness, it participates in an annual salary
      survey of the banking sector to understand key market trends as well as get insights on relative market pay
      position compared to peers. The Bank endeavors to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market
      in terms of fixed pay over time. This coupled with key internal data indicators like performance score, job
      family, experience, job grade and salary budget form the basis of decision making on revisions in fixed pay.
    </p>

    <p>
      Increments in fixed pay for majority of the employee population are generally undertaken once every financial
      year. However, promotions, confirmations and change in job dimensions could also lead to a change in the fixed pay
      during other times of the financial year.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Bank also makes salary corrections and adjustments during the financial year for competitive pay positioning
      for the purpose of retention of critical skills and critical talent in the domain of Information Technology,
      Digital, Information Security, Data Science as well as business segments that are strategic focus areas of the
      Bank. However, such pay revisions are done on an exception basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Fixed Pay for the Material Risk Takers (other than Whole time Directors), Senior Management, Key Management
      Personnel is approved by the NRC and the Board. The Fixed Pay for the Whole time Directors is approved by the NRC,
      Board and the Reserve Bank of India.

      C. Description of the ways in which current and future risks are taken into account in the remuneration processes,
      including the nature and type of the key measures used to take account of these risks
    </h3>

    <p>
      The Bank takes into account various types of risks in its remuneration processes. The Bank follows a comprehensive
      framework that includes within its ambit the key dimensions of remuneration such as fixed pay, variable pay and
      long term incentives (i.e. Employee Stock Options).
    </p>

    <p>
      Fixed pay: The Bank conducts a comprehensive market benchmarking study to ensure that employees are competitively
      positioned in terms of fixed pay. The Bank follows a robust salary review process wherein revisions in fixed
      compensation are based on performance. The Bank also makes salary adjustments taking into consideration pay
      positioning of employees vis-à-vis market reference points. Through this approach the Bank endeavors to ensure
      that the talent risk due to attrition is mitigated. Fixed pay could be revised downwards as well, in the event of
      certain proven cases of misconduct by an employee.
    </p>

    <p>Variable pay: The Bank has distinct types of variable pay plans as given below:</p>
    <hr />
    <h2><b>SCHEDULES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</b></h2>
    <p>For the year ended March 31, 2025</p>

    <p>(a) Quarterly / monthly performance-linked pay (PLP) plans:</p>
    <p>
      All quarterly / monthly PLP plans are based on the principle of balanced scorecard framework that includes within
      its ambit both quantitative and qualitative factors including key strategic objectives that ensure future
      competitive advantage for the Bank. PLP plans, by design, have deterrents that play a role of moderating payouts
      based on the non-fulfillment of established quantitative / qualitative risk factors. Deterrents also include risks
      arising out of non-compliance, mis-sell etc. Further, a portion of all payouts under the PLP plans is deferred
      till the end of the financial year to provide for any unforeseen performance risks. Employees who are part of the
      PLP plans are excluded from the Annual Bonus Plan.
    </p>

    <p>(b) Variable Pay:</p>
    <p>
      The Bank takes into consideration the fact that a portion of the Bank’s profits are directly attributable to
      various types of risks the Bank is exposed to such as credit risk and market risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The framework developed by the Bank in order to arrive at the quantum of bonus pool is based on the performance of
      the Bank and profitability. The annual variable pay is distributed based on business unit and individual
      performance and job band and role of the individual for non-business functions. The business unit performance is
      based on factors such as growth in revenue, growth in profit, cost to income ratio and achievement vis-à-vis plans
      and key objectives. Bonus pay out for an individual employee in a particular grade is linked to the performance
      rating of the employee and subject to meeting the Bank’s standards of ethical conduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bank has devised appropriate malus and claw back clauses as a risk mitigant for Whole Time Directors, Material
      Risk Takers, Senior Management (i.e. Employees in the job Bands of Executive Vice President and above). Under the
      malus clause the incumbent could forego the vesting of the deferred variable pay in full or in part. Under the
      claw back clause the incumbent is obligated to return all the tranches of variable pay payout pertaining to the
      reference performance year. The deferred variable pay is paid out post review and approval by the NRC and the
      Board.

      The performance appraisal system is based on a Balanced Scorecard Framework and considers qualitative as well as
      quantitative factors of performance which includes the parameters at overall organization level and at Target
      Business Level. Following is the list of few parameters which are covered in the Balanced Scorecards of Whole Time
      Directors.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Business Performance</b> – This includes business growth, profitability, asset quality and shareholder value.
      </li>
      <li><b>Stakeholder Relationship</b> – This includes net promoter score and corporate social responsibility.</li>
      <li>
        <b>Audit and Compliance</b> – This includes internal audit reports and compliance with the regulations and
        inspection reports.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Digital Transformation</b> – This includes performance on initiatives required to run the Bank and grow the
        Bank.
      </li>
      <li><b>People Excellence</b> – This includes succession planning and employee attrition.</li>
      <li><b>Strategic Initiatives</b> – This includes various strategic initiatives of the Bank.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The above list is not exhaustive.</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      While the above parameters form the core evaluation parameters for the Bank and the remuneration of its Whole Time
      Directors, each of the business units are measured on the following from a remuneration standpoint:
    </p>

    <ol type="a">
      <li>Growth in net revenue (%) over previous year;</li>
      <li>Growth in profit before tax (%) over previous year;</li>
      <li>Improvement in cost to income over the previous year;</li>
      <li>Improvement in Gross NPA over the previous year and</li>
      <li>Achievement of key strategic objectives.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The process by which levels of remuneration in the Bank are aligned to the performance of the Bank, business unit
      and individual employees is articulated below:
    </p>

    <p><b>Fixed Pay</b></p>

    <p>
      The Bank reviews the fixed pay portion of the compensation structure basis merit-based increments and market
      corrections. These are based on a combination of performance rating, job band and the functional category of the
      individual employee. For a given job band, the merit increment is directly related to the performance rating. The
      Bank strives to ensure that most employees progress to the median of the market in terms of fixed pay over time.
      All other things remaining equal, the correction percentage is directly related to the performance rating of the
      individual.
    </p>

    <p><b>Variable Pay</b></p>

    <p>
      Basis the performance of the business unit, individual performance and role, the Bank has formulated the following
      variable pay plans:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Variable Pay Plans:</b><br /><br />
        <i
          >For Employees in Job Bands of Sr Vice President I and above (includes employees in Senior Management,
          Material Risk Takers, Whole time Directors)</i
        >
        the variable pay intends to reward short term as well as long term sustained performance of the Bank and
        shareholder value creation.<br /><br />
        <i>Short term Performance:</i> Short term performance is realised in the form of cash variable pay. The cash
        variable pay is based on performance rating and the job band of the individual and is further enhanced or
        moderated by the business performance multiplier and role. The cash variable pay is computed on the gross
        salary.<br /><br />
        <i>Long term Performance:</i> Employee Stock Options are granted to employees based on their performance rating
        and job band and the value of the same is realised vide long term performance of the Bank and creation of
        shareholder value.<br /><br />
        <i>For Employees in job bands Vice President and below</i>:<br /><br />
        At these levels the variable pay is primarily in the form of cash variable pay and is based on the annual
        performance. In FY 2024-25, the Bank granted units at E3-D3 bands based on their performance rating, grade and
        any other such parameter as approved by the NRC.<br /><br />
        The Bank’s annual bonus is computed as a percentage of the gross salary for every job band. The bonus multiple
        is based on performance of the business unit (based on the parameters above), performance rating, job band
      </li>
    </ul>
    <hr />
    <h2><b>SCHEDULES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</b></h2>
    <p><i>For the year ended March 31, 2025</i></p>

    <p>
      and the functional category of the individual employee. The business performance category determines the
      multiplier for the bonus. All other things remaining equal, for a given job band, the bonus is directly related to
      the performance rating. Employees who are part of the annual cash Variable Pay plan are not part of the
      Performance Linked Plans mentioned below.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given
      sales, collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology. All PLP payouts are subject to the
      achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated by
      qualitative parameters. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for
      any unforeseen performance risks. All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on the plan,
      could be paid out monthly or quarterly.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b
        >E. Description of the ways in which the Bank seeks to adjust remuneration to take account of the longer term
        performance</b
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      For employees in Senior Management, Material Risk Takers and Whole Time Directors the Bank seeks to adjust
      remuneration to take account of the longer term performance in the following way.
    </p>

    <p><b>(i) Limits on variable pay</b></p>

    <p>
      A substantial portion of compensation i.e. at least 50% will be variable and paid on the basis of individual,
      business-unit and organization performance. This will be in line with the principle that, at higher levels of
      responsibility, the proportion of variable pay will be higher. The total variable pay shall be limited to a
      maximum of 300% of the fixed pay.
    </p>

    <p>
      In case the variable pay is upto 200% of the fixed pay, a minimum of 50% of the variable pay; and in case the
      variable pay is above 200%, a minimum of 67% of the variable pay shall be via non-cash instruments. The non-cash
      component in 2024-25 comprised of Employee Stock Options.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the event that the employee is barred by statute or regulation from grant of share-linked instruments, his /
      her variable pay will be capped at 150% of fixed pay but shall not be less than 50% of the fixed pay.
    </p>

    <p><b>(ii) Deferral of variable pay</b></p>

    <p>
      For senior management including Whole Time Directors (WTDs) and Material Risk Takers (MRTs), deferral arrangements
      will exist for the variable pay. A minimum of 60% of total variable pay will be under deferral arrangements. If
      cash component is a part of the variable pay, at least 50% of the cash bonus shall be deferred. In cases where
      cash component of the bonus is under Rs 25 lakh, deferral arrangements would not be necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
      The deferral period would be a minimum of three years and will be applicable to both cash and non-cash components
      of variable pay. The deferral period for share linked instruments / ESOPs will be governed by the ESOP Scheme
      Rules which will be approved by the NRC and the Board. In 2023-24, the deferment of cash variable pay, where
      applicable, was 3 years in the case of cash variable pay and 4 years (vesting period) in the case of Employee
      Stock Options.
    </p>

    <p><b>(iii) Vesting of Variable Pay</b></p>

    <p>
      The deferred portion of the remuneration will vest at the end of deferral period and will be spread out over the
      course of the deferral period. The first vesting would not be before one year from the commencement of the
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      deferral period. The vesting would be no faster than on a pro rata basis and the frequency of the vesting would be
      more than a year in order to ensure appropriate assessment of risk.
    </p>

    <p><b>(iv) Malus / Clawback Arrangement:</b></p>

    <p>
      The Bank believes in sustained business performance in tandem with prudent risk taking. The Bank, therefore, has
      devised appropriate deterrents in order to institutionalize the aforementioned commitment.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Malus Arrangement:</b> The provision of a Malus arrangement would entail cancellation of payout for the
      deferred portion of reward (cash variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument). The
      RBI guidelines define malus thus “<b>A malus</b> arrangement permits the bank to prevent vesting of all or part of
      the amount of a deferred remuneration. Malus arrangement does not reverse vesting after it has already occurred.”
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Clawback Arrangement:</b> The provision of Clawback arrangement would entail return of payout of reward (cash
      variable pay / long term incentive (LTI) i.e. any Share Linked Instrument) made in the previous years attributable
      to a given reference year wherein the incident has occurred. The return would be in terms of net amount. The RBI
      guidelines define clawback thus “A <b>clawback</b> is a contractual agreement between the employee and the bank in
      which the employee agrees to return previously paid or vested remuneration to the bank under certain
      circumstances.”
    </p>

    <p>
      The malus and clawback clause will be actioned when the employee demonstrates behaviour involving fraudulent
      behaviour, moral turpitude, lack of integrity, flagrant breach of company policies and statutory norms resulting
      in financial or non-financial losses. Manifestation of behaviour listed above is presumed to have a malafide
      intent. Illustrative list of conditions are enumerated below. The occurrence of any / some / all of the following
      conditions/ events shall trigger a review by the NRC for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement:
    </p>

    <ol type="a">
      <li>Substantial financial deterioration in profitability or risk parameters</li>
      <li>Reckless, negligent or willful actions or exhibited inappropriate values and behavior</li>
      <li>Fraud that requires a financial restatement</li>
      <li>Reputational harm</li>
      <li>Exposing the bank to substantial risk</li>
      <li>
        Such other conditions or events, of similar nature as above, as determined by NRC for triggering review by NRC
        for the purpose of application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      In determining the causes for deterioration in financial performance under (a), the NRC may take into
      consideration and have due regard to the fact whether the deterioration was for factors within control or whether
      it was on account of conditions like global market headwinds, industry performance, changes in legal / regulatory
      regime, force majeure events like occurrence of natural disasters, pandemic, other socio-economic conditions etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      While undertaking the review for the concerned person for the application of the Malus or the Clawback arrangement
      based on any trigger events, when determining accountability of the concerned person, the NRC shall be guided by
      the principles of proportionality, culpability or proximity or nexus to the event or misconduct.
    </p>

    <p>
      In accordance with the RBI guidelines, wherever the assessed divergence in bank’s provisioning for Non-Performing
      Assets (NPAs) or asset classification exceeds the prescribed threshold for public disclosure, the bank shall not
      pay the unvested portion of the variable compensation for the assessment year under ‘malus’ arrangement. Further,
      in such situations, no proposal for increase in variable pay (for the assessment year) shall be entertained. In
      case the bank’s
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h2><b>SCHEDULES TO THE STANDALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</b></h2>
    <p><i>For the year ended March 31, 2025</i></p>

    <p>
      post assessment Gross NPAs are less than 2.0%, these restrictions will apply only if criteria for public
      disclosure are triggered either on account of divergence in provisioning or both provisioning and asset
      classification.
    </p>

    <p>
      The NRC may decide to apply malus on part, or all of the unvested deferred Variable pay. The time horizon for the
      application of malus / clawback clause shall be four years from the date of reward.
    </p>

    <p>
      The NRC shall review the act of misconduct / incident to ascertain the degree of accountability attributable to a
      Whole Time Director / Material Risk Taker / Senior Management (C1 and above) prior to applying the Malus or
      Clawback arrangement.
    </p>

    <p>The criteria for Malus / Clawback will be reviewed by the NRC annually.</p>

    <p>
      The NRC and Board of Directors has also approved an addendum (Addendum-B) to the compensation policy on Clawback
      of Incentive Compensation in view of the final rules on listing standards for the recovery of erroneously awarded
      compensation adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 26, 2022, applicable to companies listed
      on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.
    </p>

    <p>
      This Addendum-B shall be read with, and is in addition to, the Compensation Policy formulated and approved by the
      Board of Directors of the Bank. The same has been formulated to comply with the requirements of Section 10D
      promulgated under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”), and Section 303A.14 of
      the NYSE so as to recover certain compensation in the event of an accounting restatement due to any material
      non-compliance relating to any financial reporting requirements under the applicable U.S. securities laws, and
      shall be interpreted and applied consistent therewith.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b><i>Employees other than Whole Time Directors, Material Risk Takers and Senior Management</i></b>
    </p>

    <p>The Bank has formulated the following variable pay plans:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Annual Cash Variable Pay plan:</b></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The quantum of variable payout is a function of the performance of the Bank, performance of the individual
      employee, job band of the employee and the functional category. Basis these key determinants and due adjustment
      for risk alignment, a payout matrix for variable pay is developed. Market trends for specific businesses /
      functions along with inputs from compensation surveys may also be used in finalising the payout.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bonus pools are designed to meet specific business needs therefore resulting in differentiation in both the
      quantum and the method of payout across functions. Typically, higher levels of responsibility receive a higher
      proportion of variable pay vis-à-vis fixed pay.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>For Employees in Job Bands of Sr Vice President 1 and above</i> Variable Pay intends to reward short term as
      well as long term sustained performance of the Bank and shareholder value creation.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Short term Performance:</i> Short term performance is realised in the form of cash variable pay. The cash
      variable pay is based on performance rating and the job band of the individual and is further enhanced or
      moderated by the business performance multiplier and role. The cash variable pay is computed on the gross salary.
    </p>

    <p>
      <i>Long term Performance:</i> Employee Stock Options are granted to employees based on their performance rating
      and Job band and the value of the same is realised vide long term performance of the Bank and creation of
      shareholder value. The vesting period for Employee Stock Option is 4 years.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Bank has also granted Restricted Stock Units (Units) to employees at E3-D3 bands. The units would vest over 4
      years.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <b>• Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)</b><br />
      The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given
      sales, collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology. All PLP payouts are subject to the
      achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated by
      qualitative parameters. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for
      any unforeseen performance risks. All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on the plan,
      could be paid out monthly or quarterly.

        the Bank utilises and the rationale for using these different forms</b
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      The Bank recognises the importance of variable pay in reinforcing a pay for performance culture. Variable pay
      stimulates employees to stretch their abilities to exceed expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>• Annual Cash Variable Pay</b><br />
      These are paid to reward performance for a given financial year. This covers all employees (excluding employees
      under PLPs). This is based on performance of the business unit, performance rating, job band and functional
      category of the individual. For higher job bands the proportion of variable pay to total compensation tends to be
      higher. For Material Risk Takers, Senior Management and Whole Time Directors 50% of the cash variable pay is
      deferred over 3 years in the event the cash variable pay exceeds 25 lakhs.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>• Performance-linked Plans (PLPs)</b><br />
      The Bank has formulated PLPs for its sales, collections, customer service and relationship roles who are given
      sales, collections and service targets basis a balanced scorecard methodology. All PLP payouts are subject to the
      achievement of individual targets enumerated in the respective scorecards of the employees and moderated by
      qualitative parameters. A portion of the PLP payouts is deferred till the end of the financial year to provide for
      any unforeseen performance risks. All PLPs are based on a balanced scorecard framework and, depending on the plan,
      could be paid out monthly or quarterly.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>• Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP)</b><br />
      This is to reward for contribution of employees in creating a long term, sustainable earnings and enhancing
      shareholder value. Only employees in a certain job band and with a specific performance rating are eligible for
      stock options. Performance is the key criteria for granting stock options.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>• Restricted Stock Units (Units)</b><br />
      The Bank granted Restricted Stock Units (Units) to employees at E3-D3 bands in FY24-25. The units would vest over
      4 years.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Quantitative disclosures</b><br />
      The quantitative disclosures for the financial year ended March 31, 2025 cover the Bank’s Whole Time Directors and
      Material Risk Takers. The material risk takers are identified in accordance with the revised guidelines on
      remuneration issued by the RBI on November 04, 2019. Hitherto, the quantitative disclosures would cover the Bank’s
      Whole Time Directors and Key Risk Takers as per the erstwhile guidelines on remuneration dated January 13, 2012.

    <h3>19.6 Implementation of IFRS converged Indian Accounting Standards</h3>
    <p>
      The Ministry of Corporate Affairs, in its press release dated January 18, 2016, had issued a roadmap for
      implementation of Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) for scheduled commercial banks, insurers / insurance
      companies and non-banking financial companies, which was subsequently confirmed by the RBI through its circular
      dated February 11, 2016. This roadmap required these institutions to prepare Ind AS based financial statements for
      the accounting periods beginning April 01, 2018 with comparatives for the periods beginning April 01, 2017. The
      implementation of Ind AS by banks requires certain legislative changes in the format of financial statements to
      comply with the disclosures required under Ind AS. In April 2018, the RBI deferred the implementation of Ind AS by
      a year by when the necessary legislative amendments were expected. The legislative amendments recommended by the
      RBI are under consideration by the Government of India. Accordingly, the RBI, through its circular dated March 22,
      2019, deferred the implementation of Ind AS until further notice.

    <h3>Provident fund</h3>
    <p>
      The guidance note on AS-15, Employee Benefits, states that employer established provident funds, where interest is
      guaranteed are to be considered as defined benefit plans and the liability has to be valued. The Institute of
      Actuaries of India (IAI) has issued a guidance note on valuation of interest rate guarantees on exempt provident
      funds. The actuary has accordingly valued the same and the Bank held a provision of Nil as at March 31, 2025
      (previous year: Nil), towards the present value of the guaranteed interest benefit obligation. The actuary has
      followed the deterministic approach as prescribed by the guidance note.

    <h3><a name="31"></a>31. Earnings per equity share</h3>

    <p>
      Basic and diluted earnings per equity share of the Bank have been calculated based on the net profit after tax of
      ₹ 67,347.36 crore (previous year: ₹ 60,812.28 crore) and the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding
      during the year of 7,62,77,93,180 (previous year: 7,08,48,07,443). The dilutive impact is on account of stock
      options / units granted to employees by the Bank. There is no impact of dilution on the profits in the current
      year and previous year.

            and interest rate swaps with inter-bank participants on its own account and for customers. Forward exchange
            contracts are commitments to buy or sell foreign currency at a future date at the contracted rate. Currency
            swaps are commitments to exchange cash flows by way of interest / principal in one currency against another,
            based on predetermined rates. Interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange fixed and floating interest
            rate cash flows. The notional amounts of financial instruments such as foreign exchange contracts and
            derivatives provide a basis for comparison with instruments recognised on the Balance Sheet but do not
            necessarily indicate the amounts of future cash flows involved or the current fair value of the instruments
            and, therefore, do not indicate the Bank’s exposure to credit or price risks. The derivative instruments
            become favorable (assets) or unfavorable (liabilities) as a result of fluctuations in market rates or prices
            relative to their terms.

Identification of a lease requires significant judgment. The Company uses significant judgement in assessing the lease term (including anticipated renewals) and the applicable discount rate. The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with both periods covered by an option to extend the lease if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and periods covered by an option to terminate the lease if the Company is reasonably certain not to exercise that option. In assessing whether the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for the Company to exercise the option to extend the lease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The Company revises the lease term if there is a change in the non-cancellable period of a lease. The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.<br>\nLeasehold land is amortised over the lease period.</p>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Asset Class</th>\n      <th>Useful Life</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Land</td>\n      <td>60 Years to 100 Years</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Buildings</td>\n      <td>1 Year to 4 Years</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Vehicles</td>\n      <td>1 Year to 4 Years</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><b>(k) <span style=\"color:green;\">Income Tax</span></b><br>\nIncome tax expense comprises current and deferred tax.

Current tax</b><br>\nCurrent tax comprises the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to the tax payable or receivable in respect of previous years. It is measured using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.

Where the Company’s management has elected to present fair value gains and losses on equity investments in other comprehensive income, there is no subsequent reclassification of fair value gains and losses to profit or loss. Dividends from such investments are recognised in profit and loss as other income when the Company’s right to receive payments is established.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>De-recognition</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li>A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a Company of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised (i.e. removed from the Company’s balance sheet) when:</li>\n  <ul>\n    <li>The rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or</li>\n    <li>The Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement; and either (a) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.</li>\n    <li>When the Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-through arrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risks and rewards of ownership. When it has neither transferred nor retained substantially all of the risks and rewards of the asset, nor transferred control of the asset, the Company continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Company’s continuing involvement. In that case, the Company also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability are measured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Company has retained.</li>\n    <li>Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Company could be required to repay.</li>\n  </ul>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Impairment of financial assets</h3>\n<p>In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure:</p>\n<ol type=\"a\">\n  <li>Financial assets that are debt instruments, and are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits, and bank balance</li>\n  <li>Trade receivables - The application of simplified approach does not require the Company to track changes in credit risk.

Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109.</p>\n<p>Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in the profit and loss.</p>\n<p>Financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition at fair value through profit and loss are designated at the initial date of recognition, and only if the criteria in Ind AS 109 are satisfied. For liabilities designated as FVTPL, fair value gains/ losses attributable to changes in own credit risk are recognised in OCI. These gains/loss are not subsequently transferred to profit and loss. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. All other changes in fair value of such liability are recognised in the statement of profit and loss. The Company has not designated any financial liability as at fair value through profit and loss.</p>\n\n<h3>Loans and borrowings</h3>\n<p>After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit and loss when the liabilities are derecognised.</p>\n<p>Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit and loss.</p>\n<p>This category generally applies to interest-bearing loans and borrowings.</p>\n\n<h3>De-recognition</h3>\n<p>A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.</p>\n\n<h3>Offsetting of financial instruments</h3>\n<p>Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet where there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company or the counterparty.</p>\n\n<h3>Derivative financial instruments</h3>\n<p>The Company uses derivative financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risks. For contracts where hedge accounting is not followed, such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value through profit and loss. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative.</p>",

Provisions are recognised at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date. If the effect of time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.<br><br>\nThe Company records a provision for decommissioning costs towards site restoration activity. Decommissioning costs are provided at the present value of future expenditure using a current pre-tax rate expected to be incurred to fulfil decommissioning obligations and are recognised as part of the cost of the underlying assets.\n</p>",

In cases, where the useful lives are different from that prescribed in Schedule II, they are based on management estimate, taking into account the nature of the asset, the estimated usage of the asset, the operating conditions of the asset, past history of replacement, anticipated technological changes, manufacturers’ warranties and maintenance support. Assumptions also need to be made, when the Company assesses, whether an asset may be capitalised and which components of the cost of the asset may be capitalised.</p>",

Key actuarial assumptions include discount rate, trends in salary escalation and vested future benefits and life expectancy. The discount rate is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. The period to maturity of the underlying bonds correspond to the probable maturity of the post-employment benefit obligations.\n  </li>\n  <li><b>Provisions and contingent liabilities</b><br>\n    The Company exercises judgment in measuring and recognising provisions and the exposures to contingent liabilities related to pending litigation or other outstanding claims subject to negotiated settlement, mediation, arbitration or government regulation, as well as other contingent liabilities. Judgment is necessary in assessing the likelihood that a pending claim will succeed, or a liability will arise, and to quantify the possible range of the financial settlement. Because of the inherent uncertainty in this evaluation process, actual losses may be different from the originally estimated provision.\n  </li>\n  <li><b>Measurement of fair values</b><br>\n    The Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities. The Company has an established control framework with respect to the measurement of fair values. The finance team has overall responsibility for overseeing all significant fair value measurements, including Level 3 fair values, and reports directly to the CFO.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>They regularly review significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information is used to measure fair values then the finance team assesses the evidence obtained from the third parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should be classified.</p>\n\n<p>When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company uses observable market data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.</li>\n  <li>Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).</li>\n  <li>Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If the inputs used to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, then the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.</p>\n\n<p><b><u>(u) Recent pronouncements</u></b><br>\nMinistry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) notifies new standard or amendments to the existing standards under Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules as issued from time to time. During the year ended 31<sup>st</sup> March, 2025, MCA has notified Ind AS 117 - Insurance Contracts and amendments to Ind As 116 – Leases, relating to sale and lease back transactions, applicable from 1<sup>st</sup> April, 2024. The Company has assessed that there is no significant impact on its financial statements.</p>\n\n<p>On 9<sup>th</sup> May, 2025, MCA notifies the amendments to Ind AS 21 - Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. These amendments aim to provide clearer guidance on assessing currency exchangeability and estimating exchange rates when currencies are not readily exchangeable. The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1<sup>st</sup> April, 2025. The Company is currently assessing the probable impact of these amendments on its financial statements.</p>",

Measurement of fair values</b></h3>\n<p>\n  Ind AS 107, ‘Financial Instrument - Disclosure’ requires classification of the valuation method of financial instruments measured at fair value in the Balance Sheet, using a three level fair-value-hierarchy (which reflects the significance of inputs used in the measurements). The hierarchy gives the highest priority to un-adjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and lowest priority to un-observable inputs (Level 3 measurements). Fair value of derivative financial assets and liabilities are estimated by discounting expected future contractual cash flows using prevailing market interest rate curves. The three levels of the fair-value-hierarchy under Ind AS 107 are described below:\n</p>\n\n<p><b>Level 1:</b> Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices.</p>\n<p><b>Level 2:</b> The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.</p>\n<p><b>Level 3:</b> If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level3.</p>\n\n<p><b>Transfers between Levels</b><br>\nThere have been no transfers between Levels during the reporting periods\n</p>",

Risk management framework</b><br>\nThe Company’s board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework. The board of directors is responsible for developing and monitoring the Company risk management policies.<br>\nThe Company’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company’s activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to maintain a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.<br>\nThe audit committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the company’s risk management policies and procedures, and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The audit committee is assisted in its oversight role by internal audit. Internal audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the audit committee.\n</p>\n\n<p><b>ii. Credit risk</b><br>\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company's receivables from customers and investments in debt securities, cash and cash equivalents, mutual funds, bonds, etc.<br>\nThe carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.\n</p>\n\n<p><b>Trade and other receivables</b><br>\nAround 71% of the sales are export sales. For major part of the sales, customer credit risk is managed by requiring domestic and export customers to pay advances before transfer of ownership, therefore substantially eliminating the Company’s credit risk in this respect.<br>\nBased on prior experience and an assessment of the current economic environment, management believes that no provision is required for credit risk wherever credit is extended to customers.\n</p>",

The prospective hedge effectiveness test is a forward looking evaluation of whether or not the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging position are expected to be highly effective on offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged position over the term of the relationship. On the other hand, the retrospective hedge effectiveness test is a backward-looking evaluation of whether the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging position have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged position since the date of designation of the hedge.</p>\n\n<p>Hedge effectiveness is assessed through the application of critical terms match method.
